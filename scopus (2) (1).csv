Therefore, a dynamic SWOT matrix is used to present the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats of the development of the Mexican Central Bank Digital Currency. In addition, an analysis of the stablecoins of the Mexican peso is made to know their landscape and current use, the above making use of Blockchain explorers such as BscScan, Etherscan, Polygonscan, and Tronscan. MMXN, Moneta Digital, is the stablecoin of the Mexican Peso with the most significant number of users and transactions. According to the results obtained, it is shown that the Mexican CBDC is viable, but it must overcome challenges and issues to be implemented and used by the population. © 2023, Universidad de Guadalajara.

We find that a gradual and permanent increase in the domestic households' preferences toward the foreign CBDC leads to a structural reduction in economic activity, especially if the CBDC is designed to be similar to domestic deposits. Imposing capital flow management measures on outflows, relaxing macroprudential policy, or selling foreign reserves can smooth the transition. A Taylor rule that targets PPI inflation is more effective in limiting the disruptive effects than a CPI targeting or an exchange rate peg. A central bank's liquidity facility available to commercial banks is able to avoid the long-run GDP loss, at the cost of a larger short-run consumption fall. We also show that an economy with a large stock of foreign CBDC is better shielded from exogenous increases in the interest rate on foreign debt, if the CBDC remuneration remains constant. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Central bank digital currency; DSGE model; Financial globalization; Open economy macroeconomics","","","","","","","","Adler G., Casas C., Cubeddu L., Gopinath G., Li N., Meleshchuk S., Buitron C.O., Puy D., Timmer Y., Dominant Currencies and External Adjustment, (2020); Adrian T., Erceg C., Linde J., Zabczyk P., Zhou J., A Quantitative Model for the Integrated Policy Framework, (2020); Adrian T., Erceg C.J., Kolasa M., Linde J., Zabczyk P., A Quantitative Microfounded Model for the Integrated Policy Framework, (2021); Agur I., Ari A., Dell'Ariccia G., Designing central bank digital currencies, J.

Digital currencies differ widely in energy consumption depending on how they are designed. We draw on academic, institutional, and industry estimates of the energy use resulting from the processing and settlement of payments to compare digital currencies to each other and to existing payment systems. Results show that, depending on their designs, digital currencies have the potential to aid in reducing energy consumption compared to the current payment system. Energy efficient designs limit payment system actors and redundancies. For distributed ledger technologies (DLT), the key factors affecting energy consumption are the ability to control participation and the consensus algorithm. Estimates for prospective non-DLT digital currencies match the lowest energy consumption of the DLT-based designs. We discuss the relation between these findings and the energy profile of potential Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDC) that are under consideration. © 2023 International Monetary fund","CBDC; Crypto assets; Digital currencies; Distributed ledger technology; Energy consumption","electricity industry; energy use; technological change","","","","","","","Agur I., Ari A., Dell'Ariccia G., Designing central bank digital currencies, J.

Drawing on an international database on CBDC adoption, data on 1176 banks operating in 86 countries from 2010 to 2021 were used to construct a time-varying CBDC adoption index. Our key results suggest that the adoption of CBDC contributes to financial stability. Furthermore, bank size, capitalization, operational strategy, deposit funding and domestic investment also contribute positively while loan loss reserve negatively affects bank stability. These findings are robust to a comprehensive set of tests. We further find that CBDC helps to reduce leverage and asset risks. Other evidence suggests that the adoption of CBDC can be associated with expanded lending, increased asset quality and reduced loan loss reserves. However, the impact of CBDC is only pronounced for banks of reasonable size but not for smaller banks. Moreover, CBDC adoption appears to have a more positive impact in emerging economies than in advanced economies. Finally, retail CBDC is found to promote stability, whereas wholesale CBDC hampers it. Overall, our findings have profound implications for the adoption of CBDCs and their implications for financial stability. © 2023 The Author(s)","Banking sector; CBDC; CBDC adoption index; Central banking; Financial stability; Retails CBDC; Wholesale CBDC","","","","","","Đại học Kinh tế Thành phố Hồ Chí Minh","This study is funded by the University of Economics Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.","Agur I., Ari A., Dell'Ariccia G., Designing central bank digital currencies, J.

Accordingly, on-going innovations in digital technologies and the globalization of the economy are expected to have significant impacts on central banking in the future. Since all the core activities of central banking, such as the issuance of money, the operation of settlement systems, its function as lender of last resort and its monetary policy, are based upon ""trust"", its history has been, and its future will also be, closely linked to the most efficient framework in terms of building trust and reflecting changing technological and institutional conditions. Even though digital innovation may influence the styles of central banks in the future, the relevance and effectiveness of their payment and settlement infrastructures, their function as lenders of last resort and their monetary policies will be maintained. Besides, the need for risk-free central bank money will remain strong on account of its capacity to reduce risks in economic transactions, and central banks will have to continue making efforts to meet these demands through the enhancement of the utility of their infrastructure, including real-time gross settlement systems. Regarding central bank digital currencies, many issues require further examination. The future of central banking will be closely interlinked with that of nation states and depends on its capacity to identify the ideal mode of utilizing information and data in the economy. © 2019 CONVIVIUM, association loi de 1901.","central bank digital currency; central banking; innovation; lender of last resort; monetary policy; payment system; real-time gross settlement; technology","","","","","","","","Amamiya M., The future of money, Speech at the 2018 Autumn Annual Meeting of the Japan Society of Monetary Economics, (2018); Amemiya T., Kodai Girisha to Kodai Chugoku no Kahei Keizai to Keizai Shisou (Economy and economics of ancient greece and ancient China), IMES Discussion paper series 2012-J-1, (2012); Re-thinking the lender of last resort, (2014); Central bank digital currencies, (2018); The Bank of England Act 1998, the Charters of the Bank and related documents, (2015); Bernanke B., Reinhart V., Conducting monetary policy at very low short-term interest rates, American Economic Review, Papers and Proceedings, 94, 2, pp. 85-90, (2004); Biondi Y., Banking, money and credit: A systemic perspective, Accounting, Economics and Law: A Convivium, 8, 2, (2018); Bordo M., A brief history of Central Banks, Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland Economic Commentaries, (2007); Broadbent B., Central banks and digital currencies, Speech at London School of Economics, (2016); Burns A., Money and monetary policy in early times, (1927); Cleland V., Transforming our payments infrastructure, Speech at Payment International, (2018); Coeure B., The future of central bank money, Speech at the International Center for Monetary and Banking Studies, (2018); The role of central bank money in payment systems, CPMI Papers No, (2003); Edvinsson R., Jacobson T., Waldenstrom D., Sveriges Riksbank and the history of Central Banking, (2018); Payment systems: Liquidity saving mechanisms in a distributed ledger environment, (2017); Securities settlement systems: Delivery-versus-payment in a distributed ledger environment, (2018); Goetzman W., Money changes everything: How finance made civilization possible, (2016); Hayek F.A., The denationalization of money, (1976); Hibbert C., The house of medici: Its rise and fall, (1999); Ingves S., Do we need an e-krona?

I build a general equilibrium framework to explicitly allow money laundering by agents and income audits by a government. I find that as long as CBDC offers less anonymity than cash, introducing CBDC will decrease money laundering. However, if CBDC still offers a relatively high level of anonymity but a low interest rate, then introducing CBDC will decrease the output from not only agents who launder money but also agents who do not. If CBDC instead offers low anonymity and a high interest rate, then introducing CBDC can increase aggregate welfare without lowering output. Furthermore, introducing CBDC needs not increase the funding costs of banks or decrease bank lending. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.","Banking; Central bank digital currency; Monetary policy; Money laundering","","","","","","","","Agur I., Ari A., Dell'Ariccia G., Designing central bank digital currencies, Journal of Monetary Economics, 125, pp. 62-79, (2022); Ahnert T., Hoffmann P., Monet C., The digital economy, privacy, and CBDC, (2022); Ait Lahcen M., Informality, frictional markets and monetary policy, (2020); Ait Lahcen M., Gomis-Porqueras P., A model of endogenous financial inclusion: implications for inequality and monetary policy, Journal of Money, Credit, and Banking, 53, 5, pp. 1175-1209, (2021); Andolfatto D., Assessing the impact of central bank digital currency on private banks, The Economic Journal, 131, 634, pp. 525-540, (2021); Andolfatto D., Williamson S., Scarcity of safe assets, inflation, and the policy trap, Journal of Monetary Economics, 73, pp. 70-92, (2015); Aruoba S.B., Institutions, tax evasion, and optimal policy, Journal of Monetary Economics, 118, pp. 212-229, (2021); Bajaj A., Damodaran N., Consumer payment choice and the heterogeneous impact of India's demonetization, Journal of Economic Dynamics and Control, 137, (2022); Banet J., Lebeau L., Central bank digital currency: Financial inclusion vs. disintermediation, (2022); Bank of Canada, Contingency planning for a central bank digital currency, (2020); Bank of Canada, European Central Bank, Bank of Japan, Sveriges Riksbank, Swiss National Bank, Bank of England, Board of Governors Federal Reserve System, Bank for International Settlements, Central bank digital currencies: foundational principles and core features, (2020); Bank of England, Central bank digital currency: opportunities, challenges and design, (2020); Barone R., Masciandaro D., Cryptocurrency or usury?

Blockchain or Distributed Ledger technology (DLT) can be used to implement CBDC to execute and settle peer-to-peer transactions. With the emergence of private money, such as cryptocurrencies and stablecoins, and the growing use of digital payments to lessen the global pandemic spread, CBDC is an active research area among central banks worldwide. Many central banks started their CBDC projects by building DLT proofs of concept (PoCs) to replicate wholesale payment systems and expand their investigation into other use cases, such as delivery versus Payment (DvP) and cross-border remittance. Many large economies like the United States have projects exploring CBDC. The People’s Bank of China (PBoC), China Central Bank, has already started a pilot testing of their digital retail currency. This paper discusses the application of blockchain for CBDC by presenting CBDC projects by central banks.

Design/methodology/approach: Drawing upon the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), the study examines the relationships between cognitive beliefs (perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, perceived trust, perceived self-efficacy, perceived cost and awareness), affective belief (attitude) and adoption intention of the digital rupee. The study uses a structured questionnaire to collect primary data from 1,707 respondents, which are then analyzed using structural equation modeling. Findings: The results indicate that perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use significantly impact users' attitudes toward the digital rupee, as well as their adoption intentions. The findings further reveal that perceived trust, perceived self-efficacy, and awareness positively influence attitude and adoption intention. On the other hand, perceived cost exhibits a negative effect on attitude and adoption intention. These results provide empirical evidence on the factors that shape users' attitudes and intentions toward adopting the digital rupee. Research limitations/implications: The research methodology used in this study ensures rigorous data collection and analysis. The structured questionnaire enabled the collection of detailed information from a large sample of respondents, allowing for robust statistical analysis. The utilization of structural equation modeling facilitated the examination of complex relationships among variables, enhancing the reliability and validity of the findings. Practical implications: The study's findings offer practical guidance for policymakers, financial institutions and researchers in shaping digital currency regulatory frameworks, tailored financial services and further exploration of adoption dynamics. Social implications: The research has social implications by potentially influencing the way individuals and communities in India engage with digital currencies, impacting financial inclusion and digital economic participation. Originality/value: This research contributes to the understanding of the adoption of digital currencies in India and provides valuable insights for policymakers, financial institutions and researchers in the field of digital finance and technology adoption. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Adoption intentions;

CBDCs are heavily researched, with pilot projects being conducted worldwide. Following the emergence of cryptocurrencies and a decrease in cash usage for retail transactions, CBDCs are viewed as the possible payment solution of the future. Using a qualitative approach, we conduct expert and non-expert interviews to apply and extend existing research on attitude formation to study how individuals form attitudes towards a CBDC in Germany. We find that individuals form their attitudes towards a digital euro through the perceived benefits, limitations, and concerns regarding related payment solutions, moderated through the perceived equivalence of these related technologies and the CBDC.

In an intangible domain characterized by inexorable advancement, the shift towards a digital economy becomes essential to enhancing our worldwide position. This research, conducted as an exploratory study, utilizes ideas derived from current literature, case studies, books, and electronic resources. this comprehensive approach offers a clear understanding of key aspects of digital money, such as the idea of blockchain, its many forms and sectors, including wholesale and retail, and the examination of real-world applications in different nations. The study examines investigating phenomena such as initial coin offers (ICOs) and the revolutionary possibilities of Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) and examines important literature issued by the Reserve Bank of India, the Bank of England, and existing works on centrally backed currency, as well as by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS). The data is enhanced through documentary analysis. The article concludes with a detailed and thoughtful discussion, providing valuable ideas and outlining potential future paths. As a result, it is essential to thoroughly categorize user groups for virtual currencies, especially those that have central bank support. this study provides a comprehensive grasp of the complex processes surrounding digital money and its potential to revolutionize the Indian socio-economic system.

Which design attributes would affect the demand for CBDC? By applying a structural model to a unique Canadian survey dataset, I find that the aggregate CBDC holdings as a percentage of the total household liquid assets could range from 4–52%, based on households’ demand perspective. Allowing banks to respond to CBDC would substantially constrain the take-up of CBDC, reducing the upper bound prediction to below 20%. Important design attributes of CBDC identified are budgeting usefulness, anonymity, bundling of bank services, and rate of return. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Central bank digital currency; Demand estimation; Design attributes","","","","","","China Meeting of the Econometric Society; Econometric Society; Payments Canada; USC Marshall Business School Reading Group; Bank of Canada, BOC; University of Liverpool, UoL; Deutsche Bundesbank","I am grateful to the editor, Urban Jermann, and an anonymous referee for the extremely useful feedback that has substantially improved the paper.

By nature and essence, Bitcoin challenged and implicitly threatened central bank money and its role in the monetary system. Meanwhile, central banks have been studying cryptocurrencies and launched pilot projects on their own digital currency, the Central Bank Digital Currency. Until recently, most economists considered Bitcoin merely as a speculative asset; however, the El Salvador decision in 2021 to establish it as a legal tender (through the Bitcoin Law) questions the status quo perception of Bitcoin. Given El Salvador's legal obligation by law of their acceptance, allowing tax payments to the government and debts to be settled using Bitcoin, the Bitcoin Law challenges the boundaries of money. In light of the El Salvador experience, we consider different perspectives on the nature of money, allowing us to reject or include Bitcoin inside the money spectrum. © 2023 The Authors","CBDC; Cryptocurrencies; El salvador; Nature of money; Theories of money","","","","","","","","Alvarez F.E., Argente D., van Patten D., Are cryptocurrencies currencies?

Blockchains provide high operator-independent security and enable central banks to outsource CBDC operations while retaining control over the amount of circulating money. Scalability of blockchain depends on the possibility of decomposing the blockchain. We study how the choice of money scheme: accounts, bills, or unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs) influences the existence of secure and decomposable blockchain implementations of CBDC. We give formal definitions to money schemes, their decompositions, atomic decompositions inspired from the properties of blockchain implementations. For our formalism, we use tools from universal algebra and category theory. We present a general decomposition theory and conditions under which money schemes have atomic decompositions. Bill money schemes meet these conditions but account and UTXO schemes do not. Bill schemes enable scalable and secure implementations of CBDC while the more traditional schemes have some issues. © 2023, The Author(s).","Blockchain; Central bank digital currency; Digital cash; Sharding","","","","","","","","Buldas A., Draheim D., Gault M., Laanoja R., Nagumo T., Saarepera M., Shah S.A., Simm J., Steiner J., Tammet T., Truu A., An ultra-scalable blockchain platform for universal asset tokenization: design and implementation, IEEE Access, 10, pp. 77284-77322, (2022); Danezis G., Meiklejohn S., Centrally banked cryptocurrencies, Proceedings of NDSS’16—the 23Rd Annual Symposium on Network and Distributed System Security, pp. 1-14, (2016); : Project Hamilton Phase 1—A High Performance Payment Processing System Designed for Central Bank Digital Currencies.

This article develops a Heterogeneous Agents New Keynesian model, incorporating financial frictions, to investigate the transmission mechanism and wealth distribution effects of digital currency interest rate from two distinct perspectives: (i) the interaction between the central bank and financial intermediaries and (ii) the substitution dynamics between cash and digital currency. By comparing models that include and exclude financial intermediaries, our research uncovers that in a society where CBDC is fully implemented, the reverse actions of financial intermediaries can hinder the efficacy of the central bank’s monetary policy and result in elevated costs associated with policy formulation. Additionally, the leverage effect of financial intermediaries exacerbates wealth inequality and contributes to the expansion of investment, thereby promoting an increase in economic output. Comparing societies where CBDC entirely replaces cash with those where CBDC coexists alongside cash, this paper demonstrates that the presence of cash mitigates significant economic fluctuations triggered by CBDC, while the complete elimination of cash amplifies wealth inequality. Consequently, it is crucial for the central bank to account for the behavior of financial intermediaries when adjusting digital currency interest rate and explore the development of an appropriate interest rate mechanism tailored to digital currency. Simultaneously, maintaining cash circulation for a specific period can act as an economic stabilizer. © 2024, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to ISEG – Instituto Superior de Economia e Gestão.","Cash; Central Bank Digital Currency; Financial intermediaries; HANK; Monetary policy; Wealth inequality","","","","","","","","Achdou Y., Han J.Q., Lasry J.M., Lions P.L., Moll B., Income and wealth distribution in macroeconomics: a continuous-time approach, Rev Econ Stud, 89, 1, pp. 45-86, (2022); Atlantic Council, (2023); Ahn S., Kaplan G., Moll B., Winberry T., Wolf C., When inequality matters for macro and macro matters for inequality, NBER Macroecon Annu, 32, 1, pp. 1-75, (2018); Andolfatto D., Assessing the impact of central bank digital currency on private banks, Econ J, 131, 634, pp. 525-540, (2021); Auclert A., Monetary policy and the redistribution channel, Am Econ Rev, 109, 6, pp. 2333-2367, (2019); Bayer C., Luetticke R., Solving discrete time heterogeneous agent models with aggregate risk and many idiosyncratic states by perturbation, Quant Econ, 11, 4, pp. 1253-1288, (2020); Belke A., Beretta E., From cash to central bank digital currencies and cryptocurrencies: a balancing act between modernity and monetary stability, J Econ Stud, 47, 4, pp. 911-938, (2020); Brunnermeier M.K., Niepelt D., On the equivalence of private and public money, J Monet Econ, 106, pp. 27-41, (2019); Chiappori P.A., Paiella M., Relative risk aversion is constant: Evidence from panel data, J Eur Econ Assoc, 9, 6, pp. 1021-1052, (2011); Chiu J., Jiang J.H., Davoodalhosseini S.M., Zhu Y., Central Bank Digital Currency and Banking, Society for Economic Dynamics-Meeting Papers No, (2019); Davoodalhosseini S.M., Central bank digital currency and monetary policy, J Econ Dyn Control, 142, pp. 104-150, (2022); Egan M., Lewellen S., Sunderam A., The cross-section of bank value, Rev Financ Stud, 35, 5, pp. 2101-2143, (2022); Gertler M., Karadi P., A model of unconventional monetary policy, J Monet Econ, 58, 1, pp. 17-34, (2011); Goodfriend M., Designing resilient monetary policy frameworks for the future, the case for unencumbering interest rate policy at the zero bound, Jackson Hole Economic Policy Symposium, (2016); Kaplan G., Moll B., Violante G.L., Monetary policy according to HANK, Am Econ Rev, 108, 3, pp. 697-743, (2018); Keister T., Sanches D., Should central banks issue digital currency?, Rev Econ Stud, 90, 1, pp. 404-431, (2023); Lagos R., Wright R., A unified framework for monetary theory and policy analysis, J Polit Econ, 113, 3, pp. 463-484, (2005); Lee S., Luetticke R., Ravn M.O., Financial Frictions: Micro Vs Macro Volatility.

We use data on the United States' unbanked and underbanked populations from the Federal Deposit and Insurance Agency. Our results reveal that an increased public awareness in CBDCs is linked to a statistically significant and economically meaningful decrease in the number of unbanked individuals in the society. However, this reduction is not evenly distributed across age groups, with a more notable impact observed among individuals aged 34–64 years old. Furthermore, our findings demonstrate that an increased awareness of CBDCs correlates with reduced levels of unbanked and underbanked individuals across different levels of college education and income. It is noteworthy that awareness of CBDCs has a particularly significant impact on unbanked and underbanked populations among society's most vulnerable individuals. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.","Central bank digital currency; Seemingly unrelated regression; Unbanked; Underbanked","","","","","","","","Agur I., Ari A., Dell'Ariccia G., Designing central bank digital currencies, Journal of Monetary Economics, 125, 2022, pp. 62-79, (2022); Allen F., Gu X., Jagtiani J., Fintech, cryptocurrencies, and cbdc: Financial structural transformation in China, Journal of International Money and Finance, 102625, (2022); Andolfatto D., Assessing the impact of central bank digital currency on private banks, The Econometrics Journal, 131, 634, pp. 525-540, (2021); Bae K., Wang W., What's in a “China” name?

We argue that the hedging behavior of participants in the currency futures market could be more informative than CBDC uncertainty news in the presence of limited risk absorption capacity in futures markets. We show that the hedging factor has a statistically significant effect on financial market risk aversion and measures of uncertainty. The hedging behavior of currency futures market participants is informative of agents' reactions to the news and central bank policies around CBDC. Our results also show that CBDC uncertainty is a significant risk transmitter in the financial system. Hence, this characteristic makes the hedging factor even more important because it can directly impact risk aversion via its moderating effects, which later influence CBDC uncertainty. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.","CBDC;

The digital euro under consideration represents a retail central bank digital currency (CBDC), a digital representation of central bank money that is intended for use by the general public. This article foregrounds the digital euro as an infrastructure that furthers European security ambitions. It argues that the development of the digital euro is a materialization of European (in)security rationales that aim to secure pan-European financial transactions amid growing geopolitical tensions. It focuses on the development of the technology and analyses how central bankers’ scenarios of the future manifest in the anticipated design and prototypes. While the provision of a financial infrastructure is the most decisive security-related implication of the digital euro, the introduction of a new form of public money is the decisive financial feature with potentially wide-ranging implications for banks. Although the ECB seeks to balance the interests of banks and other financial actors in the development of the digital euro, its plans are still met with criticism. Finally, the article argues that the ECB exerts itself more explicitly than before as a geopolitical actor in its own regard. © 2024 The Author(s).

The ECB carefully crafts and prepares its external communication. While it aims to explain and thereby legitimize its plans and considerations for the digital euro, its communication is limited by a specific understanding of the ECB\u2019s mandate and its self-depiction as a technocratic European institution. At the same time, the development of the digital euro is a challenge for the ECB\u2019s communication strategy. Until recently, central bank communication has been geared primarily toward financial market audiences that are able to interpret central banks\u2019 \u2018signaling\u2019 (Abolafia, ). The digital euro, however, requires support by the EU\u2019s co-legislators, the Council of the EU and the European Parliament, as well as \u2013 eventually \u2013 European citizens. To gain broader support for the project, representatives of the ECB have thus engaged in numerous public events with stakeholders, market participants, political actors and NGOs. As plans to introduce CBDCs have been a topic at several high-level conferences and meetings, many public conversations and speeches, most notably speeches by high-ranking ECB representatives, are also part of the enfolding discourse on the digital euro. This discourse has thus far been limited mainly to the central banking community, stakeholders, market participants and think tanks. To supplement the analyzed material, the author has attended several events, on and offline, dedicated to the digital euro. On these occasions, in conversation with speakers and attendants, the author gained contextual knowledge on the process and how it is perceived. The analysis also includes prototypes as part of the digital euro infrastructure to exemplify how discursive claims materialize in the technology. To sum up, the analysis focuses on two main reports and further public communication by central banks and other financial institutions \u2013 reports by the ECB, the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) \u2013 which are supplemented by statements by stakeholders, market participants and consulting companies as well as statements gathered and conversations at events dedicated to the digital euro.

However, striking a balance between privacy, transparency, and auditability in such a system is technically difficult. We propose a CBDC system based on a consortium blockchain that adopts a privacy-preserving, transparent unspent transaction output (UTXO) model. The proposed system satisfies the travel rule of payment, unlike existing cryptocurrencies. Unlike the conventional UTXO approach, users use wallet-linked addresses for transactions rather than their actual wallet addresses. Each transacting address is generated using two keys: a random private key computed by the sender and the recipient's public key. The final private key is known only to the recipient, and it is required to spend the UTXO received using the address. Thus, each user holds only a single authorized public key and address, which eases regulatory compliance in the network without compromising anonymity and privacy. To manage the blockchain, the central bank and several certificate authorities execute the energy-efficient Clique consensus algorithm. Only the central bank supplies money to the network. A prototype of the system was implemented using Python-Flask, and it outperformed the state-of-the-art systems by providing a smaller transaction size (665 B) and lower verification time (9 ms).  © 2008-2012 IEEE.","Central bank digital currency; Clique consensus algorithm; consortium blockchain; elliptic curve cryptography; unspent transaction output","Electronic money; Energy efficiency; Public key cryptography; Regulatory compliance; Block-chain; Central bank; Central bank digital currency; Clique consensus algorithm; Consensus algorithms; Consortium blockchain; Curve cryptography; Elliptic curve; Elliptic curve cryptography; Unspend transaction output; Blockchain","","","","","Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning, MSIP, (NRF-2021R1A2C2012476); National Research Foundation of Korea, NRF","This work was supported in part by the National Research Foundation (NRF) of South Korea, and in part by the Ministry of Science and ICT (MSIT) of the Korean government under Grant NRF-2021R1A2C2012476.","Allen S., Et al., Design choices for central bank digital currency: Policy and technical considerations, (2020); Whitepaper 2.0 on distributed ledger technology, (2017); Cunha P.R., Melo P., Sebastiao H., From bitcoin to central bank digital currencies: Making sense of the digital money revolution, Future Internet, 13, 7; Mikhalev I., Burchardi K., Struchkov I., Song B., Gross J., Today’s central bank digital currencies status, CBDC Tracker; Chaum D., Grothoff C., Moser T., How to issue a central bank digital currency; Zhang T., Huang Z., Blockchain and central bank digital currency, ICT Exp, 8, 2, pp. 264-270; Khalilov M.C.K., Levi A., A survey on anonymity and privacy in bitcoin-like digital cash systems, IEEE Commun.

It assessed whether global interest in sustainable development and cryptocurrency are determinants of global interest in CBDC. Design/methodology/approach: Google Trends data were analyzed using two-stage least square regression estimation. Findings: There is a significant positive relationship between global interest in sustainable development and global interest in CBDC. There is a significant positive relationship between global interest in cryptocurrency and global interest in the Nigeria eNaira CBDC. There is a significant negative relationship between global interest in CBDC and global interest in the eNaira CBDC. There is a significant positive relationship between global interest in CBDC and global interest in the China eCNY. There is a significant negative relationship between global interest in cryptocurrency and global interest in the Sand Dollar and DCash. Originality/value: The literature has not empirically examined whether global interest in sustainable development and cryptocurrency are factors motivating global interest in CBDC.

This paper explores different design features of retail CBDC and highlights terminological inconsistencies in the debate surrounding their legal status. It compares CBDC to incumbent forms of money and analyses central questions regarding their introduction from the perspective of European Union law, especially whether the ECB has to power to introduce CBDC and under which conditions CBDC would have legal tender status. For this appraisal, focus is especially put on the interpretation of the notions ‘legal tender’, ‘banknotes’, and ‘coins’ referred to in Art. 128 TFEU; the analysis is supported by experiences drawn from the legal discussion in the United States. © 2024 The Author(s).

When an organization issues an ID proof of a customer for eKYC, that proof is usually achieved in practice by a hierarchy of issuers. However, the customer wants to disclose only part of the issuer's chain and documents to the trading partner due to privacy concerns. In this research, delegatable anonymous credential (DAC) and zero-knowledge range proof (ZKRP) allow customers to arbitrarily change parts of the delegation chain and message body to range proofs expressed in inequalities. That way, customers can protect the privacy they need with their own control. Zero-knowledge proof is applied to prove the inequality between two time stamps by the time stamp server (signature presentation, public key revocation, or non-revocation) without disclosing the signature content and stamped time. It makes it possible to prove that the registration information of the national ID card is valid or invalid while keeping the user's personal information anonymous. This research aims to contribute to the realization of a sustainable financial system based on self-sovereign identity management with privacy-enhanced PKI.  © 2023 The Institute of Electronics.","anonymous credential; central bank digital currency; eKYC; PKI; privacy; zero-knowledge range proof","Authentication; Data privacy; Sales; Anonymous credential; Central bank; Central bank digital currency; EKYC; PKI; Privacy; Privacy protection; Time-stamp; Zero knowledge; Zero-knowledge range proof; Electronic money","","","","","","","Financial Integrity for sustainable development, Report of the High Level Panel on International Financial Accountability, Transparency and Integrity for Achieving the 2030 Agenda, (2021); Anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing measures - Japan, Fourth Round Mutual Evaluation Report, (2021); Camenisch J., Drijvers M., Dubovitskaya M., Practical UCsecure delegatable credentials with attributes and their application to blockchain, CCS'17, pp. 683-699, (2017); Canetti R., Universally composable security: A new paradigm for cryptographic protocols, 42nd FOCS, pp. 136-145, (2001); Bogatov D., De Caro A., Elkhiyaoui K., Tackmann B., Anonymous transactions with revocation and auditing in hyperledger fabric, Cryptology ePrint Archive: Report 2019/1097, (2020); Soltani R., Nguyen U.T., An A., A new approach to client onboarding using self-sovereign identity and distributed ledger, IEEE/ACM Int'l Conference on & Int'l Conference on Cyber, Physical and Social Computing (CPSCom) Green Computing and Communications (GreenCom), (2019); Bunz B., Bootle J., Boneh D., Poelstra A., Wuille P., Maxwell G., Bulletproofs: Short proofs for confidential transactions and more, 2018 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy, (2018); Schwarcz S.L., Central bank digital currencies and law, Duke Law School Public Law & Legal Theory Series no.2020-58, (2020); Wang F.F., Law of Electronic Commercial Transactions: Contemporary Issues in the EU, (2010); Christodorescu M., Gu W.C., Kumaresan R., Minaei M., Ozdayi M., Price B., Raghuraman S., Saad M., Sheffield C., Xu M., Zamani M., Towards a two-tier hierarchical infrastructure: An offline payment system for central bank digital currencies, (2020); Bakshi P., Nandi S., Using privacy enhancing and fine-grained access controlled eKYC to implement privacy aware eSign, Adv.

China's CBDC is fast evolving. Understanding the influencing factors of China's CBDC will likely be crucial to explore its future direction. Major influencing factors include (i) China's perception and conception of regulation and technology, (ii) complementarity between China's preferences and CBDC development, (iii) domestic and international legitimacy, and (iv) institutional development. This paper argues that these influencing factors contribute to China's likely approach of selectively reshaping the international financial system.

This study contributes to this new but important research agenda by examining how news on digitalization affects digital economy related exchange traded funds (ETFs). For this purpose, we first construct a digital economy attention index by utilizing Google Search Volume Index for several keywords. Then, using this index and two other indices that represent attention and uncertainty related to central bank digital currency (CBDC), we examine the time-varying connectedness and correlations between these three indices and digital economy ETFs. Our TVP-VAR frequency connectedness analysis shows that attention to and uncertainty around the CBDC and digital economy have strong connectedness with the ETFs in the short-term. The analysis also shows that CBDC and digital economy indices are mainly net transmitters of shocks while the majority of the ETFs are the net receivers of the shocks. The results of our wavelet local multiple correlation (WLMC) analysis show that the correlations between ETFs, digital economy and CBDC indices are time- and frequency-dependent. Moreover, both connectedness and correlations are affected by CBDC-related global events and COVID-19 pandemic. The time- and frequency-dependent relation requires active management of the portfolios containing digital economy related assets. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.","CBDC; Digital economy; ETF; Spillover; Uncertainty","","","","","","","","Abbasi K., Alam A., Du M., Huynh T.L.D., FinTech, SME efficiency and national culture: Evidence from OECD countries, Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 163, (2022); Adekoya O.B., Oliyide J.A., Saleem O., Adeoye H.A., Asymmetric connectedness between Google-based investor attention and the fourth industrial revolution assets: the case of FinTech and Robotics & Artificial intelligence stocks, Technol.

Our findings suggest that CBDC uncertainty index is negatively related to cryptocurrency and stablecoin returns. Furthermore, the CBDC attention index is negatively associated with Bitcoin, Ethereum, XPR and Terra USD, however, it is positively related to Tether, Binance, USD Coin and Dai.

We build a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium small open model economy with interest-bearing central bank digital currency assets. The redistribution of asset holdings and the change in asset price are the two pathways through which a retail central bank digital currency rule under the traditional monetary policy affects the macroeconomy. Fiat's digital and traditional monetary policies complement one another in lowering macroeconomic fluctuations. As a result, the real exchange rate, current accounts, and consumption are more stable in transmitting foreign shocks. These results occur when price-based or quantitative-based fiat digital monetary policy parallels traditional price-based monetary policy. © 2023 The Author(s)","Central bank digital currency; Economic fluctuation; Price-based monetary policy; Quantitative-based monetary policy","","","","","","","","Agur I., Ari A., Dell'Ariccia G., Designing central bank digital currencies, J.

We uncovered travelers’ intention with respect to CBDC adoption by broadening and intensifying the technology acceptance model (TAM). A total of 598 valid samples were examined and showed that TAM variables, confidence, competence, and consumer innovativeness sufficiently contribute to explicating the intention generation process of travelers for CBDC adoption. The cross-national influence of China and the US on the intention to adopt CBDC was also explored by adding nationality as a moderator. This research is one of few studies unearthing travelers’ behaviors for CBDC use, which enriches the extant tourism literature. © 2024 Scientific Journal Publishers Limited.

Initial research highlights the importance of privacy concerns on adoption intention in CBDC. We took one step further and investigated the link between privacy concerns and adoption using the Chinese CBDC and digitalized version of the Yuan, the e-CNY. We integrated and applied the established Antecedent Privacy Concerns and Outcomes (APCO) model with the Task-Technology Fit model in a quantitative online-questionnaire with 682 Chinese participants to study the influence of privacy concerns on CBDC usage. The data was analyzed using partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) to identify significant path coefficients and effects in the developed model. The findings demonstrated that several antecedents significantly influenced privacy concerns, which in turn influenced e-CNY usage. In particular, perceived vulnerabilities impacted privacy concerns, while soft and hart trust factors were found to neither impact concerns or usage. When compared to prior research, the distinction between intention to use and usage of CBDC, under consideration of privacy concerns, seemed to be negligible. The often discussed ‘privacy-paradox’ could not be observed for CBDC. Observed differences in antecedents and other factors may have been due to cultural, political, and demographic factors, as well as different CBDC design choices. For practitioners, the results further emphasized the need for a privacy-friendly implementation of retail CBDC, which efficiently communicated user benefits while rebutting perceived vulnerabilities. © 2024 the Author, licensee AIMS Press.","Adoption; CBDC; Central bank digital currency; DCEP; Digital money; E-CNY; Privacy concerns","","","","","","","","Abugabah A, Sanzogni L, Alfarraj O, Evaluating the impact of ERP systems in higher education, Int J Inf Learn Technol, 32, pp. 45-64, (2015); Ajzen I, The theory of planned behavior, Organ Behav Hum Dec, (1991); Ajzen I, Fishbein M, Understanding attitudes and predicting social behaviour, (1980); Akkaya C, Wolf P, Krcmar H, The Role of Trust in E-Government Adoption: A Literature Review, AMCIS 2010 Proceedings, (2010); Al-Amri R, Zakaria NH, Habbal A, Et al., Cryptocurrency adoption: Current stage, opportunities, and open challenges, Int J Adv Comp Res, 9, pp. 293-307, (2019); Alashoor T, Han S, Joseph RC, Familiarity with big data, privacy concerns, and self-disclosure accuracy in social networking websites: An APCO model, Commun Assoc Inf Sys, 41, pp. 62-96, (2017); Allen S, Capkun S, Zhang F, Et al., Design Choices for Central Bank Digital Currency: Policy and Technical Considerations, (2020); Alonso SLN, Can Central Bank Digital Currencies be green and sustainable?, Green Financ, 5, pp. 603-623, (2023); Alzahrani S, Daim TU, Analysis of the cryptocurrency adoption decision: Literature review, PICMET 2019 - Portland International Conference on Management of Engineering and Technology: Technology Management in the World of Intelligent Systems, Proceedings, (2019); Angino S, Ferrara FM, Secola S, The cultural origins of institutional trust: The case of the European Central Bank, Eur Union Politics, (2021); Auer R, Bohme R, The technology of retail central bank digital currency, BIS Q Rev, pp. 85-100, (2020); Auer R, Bohme R, Clark J, Et al., Mapping the Privacy Landscape for Central Bank Digital Currencies, Commun ACM, 66, pp. 46-53, (2023); Auer R, Cornelli G, Frost J, Rise of the central bank digital currencies: Drivers, approaches and technologies, (2020); Auer R, Frost J, Gambacorta L, Et al., Central Bank Digital Currencies: Motives, Economic Implications and the Research Frontier, Ann Rev Econ, (2021); Bai X, Examining factors influencing behavioral intention to adopt centralized digital currencies (CDC): An empirical study based on the integrated model of UTAUT2 and TPB, (2020); Barnes SB, A privacy paradox: Social networking in the United States, First Monday, (2006); Baronchelli A, Halaburda H, Teytelboym A, Central bank digital currencies risk becoming a digital Leviathan, Nature Hum Behav, 6, pp. 907-909, (2022); Bech M, Garratt R, Central bank cryptocurrencies, BIS Q Rev, pp. 55-70, (2017); Belanger F, Crossler RE, Privacy in the Digital Age: A Review of Information Privacy Research in Information Systems, MIS Q, 35, (2011); Benamati JH, Ozdemir ZD, Smith HJ, An empirical test of an Antecedents - Privacy Concerns - Outcomes model, J Inf Sci, 43, pp. 583-600, (2017); Berggren N, Daunfeldt SO, Hellstrom J, Social trust and central-bank independence, Eur J Polit Econ, 34, pp. 425-439, (2014); Bhatiasevi V, An extended UTAUT model to explain the adoption of mobile banking, Inf Dev, 32, pp. 799-814, (2016); Bijlsma M, van der Cruijsen C, Jonker N, Et al., What triggers consumer adoption of CBDC?, SSRN Electronic J, 709, (2021); Bossu W, Itatani M, Margulis C, Et al., Legal Aspects of Central Bank Digital Currency: Central Bank and Monetary Law Considerations, (2021); Brunner K, Meltzer A, Brunner K, Et al., The Uses of Money: Money in the Theory of an Exchange Economy, Am Econ Rev, 61, pp. 784-805, (1971); Bursian D, Furth S, Trust Me!

This would complement two other possible instruments: hard limits, whose sole use may raise some concerns, and CBDC remuneration, which in a positive rate environment is not considered a viable option. As in the case of emerging market economies with a flexible exchange rate, in a CBDC framework reserve requirements could be used as a countercyclical tool for macroeconomic stabilization to influence bank lending/funding conditions consistently with the monetary policy stance. In an ample-reserves regime, the effectiveness of this tool would be favored by retaining the interest rate on required reserves and the interest rate on excess reserves (the real key policy rate) as two distinct policy instruments, with the former remaining stable below the latter. © 2024","Bank lending; Central bank digital currency; Digital euro; Excess reserves; Monetary policy; Reserve requirement","","","","","","","","Aberg P., Corsi M., Grossmann-Wirth V., Hudepohl T., Mudde Y., Rosolin T., Schobert F., (2021); Acharya V., Rajan R., Liquidity, Liquidity Everywhere, Not a Drop to Use: Why Flooding Banks with Central Bank Reserves May Not Expand Liquidity, (2022); Afonso G., Kim K., Martin A., Nosal E., Potter S., Schulhofer-Wohl S., Monetary Policy Implementation With an Ample Supply of Reserves, (2020); Agarwal R., Kimball M., (2015); Alper K., Binici M., Demiralp S., Kara H., Ozlu P., Reserve requirements, liquidity risk, and bank lending behavior, J.

This paper aims to analyse the advantages and disadvantages of such a solution, as well as to highlight the challenges facing legislatures about the possibility of legalising digital currency and, above all, protecting the rights and freedoms of citizens participating in the process. Due to its technological nature, CBDC is characterised by a much lower level of anonymity than conventional cash, which is often presented as a disadvantage. However, an analysis of this solution seems to weigh in favour of its advantages. One of them is the possibility of using CBDCs to support the process of financial inclusion referred to in the United Nations document Transforming our world: The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. This is an important subject of academic research that can be carried out under the doctrine of financial-market law. Undoubtedly, this matter also has an increasing impact on the practice of financial-market functioning and fiscal and monetary policy decisions. In particular, financial law plays a key role in solving socioeconomic problems and is becoming an instrument for achieving the goals set by the United Nations. The research subject of CBDC is innovative and exploratory, as money, no matter how it is perceived, is, has been and will continue to be an instrument to change the world for the better. © 2024 Tomasz Nieborak published by Sciendo.","Central Bank Digital Currency; central banks; money; new technologies; sustainable development; trust","","","","","","","","Aalbers M.B., The financialization of home and the mortgage market crisis, Competition & Change, 12, 2, pp. 148-166, (2008); Central bank digital currencies: Foundational principles and core features, (2020); Project Aurum: A prototype for two-tier central bank digital currency (CBDC), (2022); Barontini C., Holden H., Proceeding with caution: A survey on central bank digital currency [BIS papers 101], (2019); Borio C., Towards a macroprudential framework for financial supervision and regulation?

The digital PSP offers a digital wallet and payment services, but does not offer credit. In contrast, banks invest their deposits in lending activities, which implies that they may incur some costs of adjusting their liquidity needs when consumers make payments. I show that the adoption of the digital wallet for payments may sometimes increase the volume of payments by bank deposit transfers and the lending rate. This results from banks’ trade-off between lowering their costs of liquidity when consumers pay from their digital wallet and reducing the revenues they receive from bank transfer fees. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.","Banking regulation; Cash; CBDC; Digital currencies; Money demand; Payment systems","","","","","","","","Adrian T., Mancini-Griffoli T., The rise of digital money, Annu.

Its issuance and circulation change the existing monetary hierarchy and monetary system. From the perspective that CBDC affects the monetary policy effectiveness, we introduce CBDC, quantity rule, and price rule into the traditional dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model, and propose a new DSGE model including households, manufacturers, the government, and the central bank. The impacts of CBDC on the effectiveness of quantity-based and price-based monetary policies are discussed separately, and three conclusions are drawn. First, the technology shock has better policy effects under the price rule. Second, the response of economic variables to the price rule shock is more significant. Third, the CBDC interest rate shock produces desirable policy effects on economic variables. Based on the above conclusions, we put forward policy suggestions and future research directions. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.","C68; Central bank digital currency; Dynamic stochastic general equilibrium; G21; G28; Monetary policy effectiveness; Price-based monetary policy; Quantity-based monetary policy","central bank; currency; general equilibrium analysis; monetary policy","","","","","National Office for Philosophy and Social Sciences, NPOPSS, (21XJY014); National Office for Philosophy and Social Sciences, NPOPSS","The authors would like to express our sincere gratitude to Prof. George Hondroyiannis, the Editor-in-Chief of the journal for his meticulous review and constructive feedback.

In our model, household preferences are determined by the perceived attributes of these instruments, and hence their choice regarding payment methods depends on the differences in these characteristics across these instruments. The results indicate that consumer choice is sensitive to the perceived characteristics at statistically significant level. We employ the estimated model to evaluate demand for central bank digital currency (CBDC), based on its expected design and consumer perceptions of it. We discuss several illustrative projections to demonstrate the application of the tool developed. The predicted use of CBDC varies considerably, depending on the perceived characteristics, although the projected use of CBDC in household transactions is limited under conservative assumptions: the projected share of digital rubles in the total number of transactions varies from 18 percent to 35 percent. © 2024 Borsa İstanbul Anonim Şirketi","Central bank digital currency; Ordered probit; Payment instruments; Russia","","","","","","Cash Circulation Department of the Bank of Russia","We are grateful to Riikka Nuutilainen, Olga Yatsyk, Sergey Likhodzievskiy and David Humphrey for their valuable comments and suggestions.

We establish conditions under which cash and CBDC can co-exist and show how government policies can influence relative holdings of cash, CBDC, and other assets.

Among the roughly 90 per cent of the world’s central banks pursuing CBDC projects, many, including those in the USA and South Africa, are at the exploratory phase. Others are already managing development projects (the European Union) and pilots (China). The various imperatives behind these initiatives are easy for private actors in these markets to overlook, which sometimes complicates private–public cooperation. However, digitally issued public money stands at the forefront of central bank innovation in the monetary space. This paper reviews why central banks need to explore digital currencies and what questions they should address. It also sheds light on what commercial banks need to consider as they anticipate their stance in the CBDC development process. For both parties, the final section outlines the hurdles to successful CBDC design and rollout. © 2023, Henry Stewart Publications.

If a CBDC is built on distributed ledger technology with token-based access, it would have even more in common with a cryptocurrency wallet than a mobile payment wallet. The unbanked population is increasingly using cryptocurrency wallets and mobile payment wallets. To promote broad adoption of a CBDC among populations currently underserved by the financial industry, governments will first need a greater understanding of the barriers to adoption. This paper examines the user-facing issues pertaining to access and financial inclusion, usability, security, privacy and interoperability, and identifies 11 key user-centred issues relating to the use of CBDC wallets, along with recommendations to address these issues. By adopting these recommendations, a CBDC wallet would better meet the needs of populations underserved by the traditional financial system. © Henry Stewart Publications, 1750-1806.","Central bank digital currency; Digital currency wallet; User experience","","","","","","","","Central Bank Digital Currency Tracker, (2022); Kumar A., Report Card on China’s Central Bank Digital Currency: the e-CNY, (2022); Hileman G., Rauchs M., Global cryptocurrency benchmarking study, SSRN, (2017); Abramova S., Voskobojnikov A., Beznosov K., Boehme R., Bits under the mattress: understanding different risk perceptions and security behaviors of crypto-asset users, Proceedings of the 2021 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, (2021); Principato C., The State of Consumer Banking & Payments Analyst Report, (2022); What is Economic Inclusion?, (2021); The Global Payments Report, (2022); Demirguc-Kunt A., Klapper L., Singer D., Ansar S., The Global Findex Database, (2021); How America Banks: Household Use of Banking and Financial Services, (2019); Principato C., Banking the unbanked requires raising trust and awareness.

These experiments demonstrate that platforms with two or more CBDCs are technically feasible and could lower costs, make settlement faster and increase operational transparency.

As there are currently four operational CBDCs and as many as ninety-four central banks, jurisdictions or currency areas are testing or investigating the launch of a retail CBDC. The study was based on a sample of 34 countries or currency areas, which were classified into three groups. This research aimed to answer the following research questions: 1. Can CBDCs be considered green and sustainable? 2. How can we determine whether a CBDC is green and sustainable? 3. Which countries are closest to having green CBDCs? It has been calculated the total and the percentage of CBDCs that could be considered green or sustainable according to each country or currency area; in this model, it has been considered one monetary unit issued in a green/sustainable CBDC format for each point that a country obtains in this model that is adjusted according to four variables: Electricity prices for households and for businesses, renewable electricity production and CO2 emissions. The countries that could launch a higher percentage of green/sustainable CBDCs in circulation would be the countries in the Eurozone and the United Kingdom, with these countries exceeding 70%. This was followed by Sweden (60%), Australia (58%) and the Bahamas (close to 54%). Only the Bahamas has its CBDC already launched and operational. Jamaica is also in the top ten and has its CBDC up and running. Japan closes the top 10 with just over 51%. Those countries with cleaner sources of power generation will be able to keep their CBDCs operating more sustainably. The environmental impact, however, will vary depending on the design choices of a CBDC and the country where it operates, according to the variables of this model. © 2023 the Author(s), licensee AIMS Press.","CBDC; digital finance; green CBDC; green finance; sustainable CBDC; sustainable digital finance","","","","","","Catholic University of Ávila; Institución Gran Duque de Alba, (3364/2022)","This research was partially funded by an incentive granted to the author by the Catholic University of \u00C1vila and by the project Finance for All (F4A), funded by the \u201CInstituci\u00F3n Gran Duque de Alba\u201D and \u201CDiputaci\u00F3n provincial de \u00C1vila\u201D, under the grant 3364/2022.","Abu-Bader SH, Using statistical methods in social science research: With a complete SPSS guide, (2021); Agur I, Lavayssiere X, Bauer GV, Et al., Lessons from Crypto Assets for the Design of Energy Efficient Digital Currencies, Ecol Econ, 212, (2023); Ahiabenu K, A Comparative Study of the Design Frameworks of the Ghanaian and Nigerian Central Banks’ Digital Currencies (CBDC), FinTech, 1, pp. 235-249, (2022); Allen F, Gu X, Jagtiani J, Fintech, Cryptocurrencies, and CBDC: Financial Structural Transformation in China, J Int Money Financ, 124, (2022); Alonso SLN, Jorge-Vazquez J, Rodriguez PA, Et al., Gender Gap in the Ownership and Use of Cryptocurrencies: Empirical Evidence from Spain, J Open Innov Technol Market Complexity, 9, (2023); Alora A, Sahoo P, Sasidharan A, Central Bank Digital Currency Adoption Challenges-The Case of an Emerging Nation, Financ Res Lett, 59, (2024); Alotaibi A, Clause J, Halfond WG, Mobile App Energy Consumption: A Study of Known Energy Issues in Mobile Applications and Their Classification Schemes-Summary Plan, 2020 IEEE International Conference on Software Maintenance and Evolution (ICSME), IEEE, (2020); Alvarez F, Argente D, Van Patten D, Are Cryptocurrencies Currencies?

A strategic analytical framework is used to investigate this innovation in the laboratory, contrasting a traditional “plain” tokens baseline to treatments with “sophisticated” interest-bearing tokens. In the experiment, this theoretically beneficial innovation precluded the emergence of a stable monetary system, reducing trade and welfare. Similar problems emerged when sophisticated tokens complemented or replaced plain tokens.

This article analyzes the state of research around central bank digital currencies and the evolving landscape of CBDCs, and explores emerging areas of research and trends by using the PRISMA method and VOSviewer, with the goal of showing the main opportunities and challenges related to them. AMSTAR, DistillerSR, Eppi-Reviewer, ROBIS, and SRDR were the screening and quality evaluation tools employed for study eligibility criteria, design screening and content selection, text analysis data extraction, methodological quality predictors, and reliable and reproducible evidence assessment. A total of 1024 articles on central bank digital currencies were identified in Scopus and the Web of Science, out of which 747 have been included in the review (documents which were not in English language and not categorized as journal articles were excluded). Through an analysis of the relevant literature, the study categorizes CBDC research into positive, negative and neutral research, with a particular focus on sustainability issues, and conducts a keyword co-occurrence analysis using VOSviewer, following a narrowing down of the relevant articles to be included in the study by applying the PRISMA framework. This generates an overall view for experts and researchers who can use the main analyzed features of CBDCs and adapt them accordingly, taking into account relevant macroeconomic characteristics. The study highlights the need to continue interdisciplinary research, by adapting the research and CBDC characteristics to keep up with the latest technologies and with the shift towards green finance, and explores the elaborate relationship between finance, technology and sustainability. © 2024 The Author(s)","CBDC; Digital currencies; e-money; Financial markets; PRISMA; Sustainability; VOSviewer","","","","","","Unitatea Executivă pentru Finanțarea Învățămîntului Superior, Cercetare; Corporation for National and Community Service, CNCS; Unitatea Executiva pentru Finantarea Invatamantului Superior, a Cercetarii, Dezvoltarii si Inovarii, UEFISCDI, (PN-III-P1-1.1-TE-2021-0795); Unitatea Executiva pentru Finantarea Invatamantului Superior, a Cercetarii, Dezvoltarii si Inovarii, UEFISCDI","Funding text 1: This paper was also made possible through the project funded by Consiliul Na\u021Bional al Cercet\u0103rii \u0218tiin\u021Bifice - Unitatea Executiv\u0103 pentru Finan\u021Barea \u00CEnv\u0103\u021B\u0103m\u00EEntului Superior, Cercetare, Dezvoltare, Inovare (CNCS - UEFISCDI), number PN\u2013III\u2013P1-1.1-TE-2021-0795.; Funding text 2: This paper was also made possible through the project funded by CNCS - UEFISCDI, number PN-III-P1-1.1-TE-2021-0795.

The model combines a neoclassical growth model with a stock-flow representation of the eurozone financial sector at a high level of aggregation. With endogenous money creation, the multidirectional relationship between asset prices and net income, and also the dual causality of both liquidity and investment relative to interest rates as the main features of the model, the developments of the past 50 years can be understood and extrapolated to 2050. The simulation experiments indicate that the current pro-cyclic system is inherently unstable. This instability can only be overcome by monetary policy that eases and tightens the total amount of money in the system in a countercyclical manner. An obvious way to achieve this is the introduction of 100% Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC). This calls for the ECB's mandate to become the sole “monetary authority” that creates and controls the amount of money in the system, with the sole and unambiguous objective of price stability. Money creation to achieve price stability at a targeted level of inflation with simultaneous repayment of public debt varies between €200 billion and €500 billion per year. This money can be channelled into the real economy through the EU's governance structure and spent on tax cuts and/or direct public investments, for example in physical and social infrastructure. © 2024 The Author(s)","Central Bank Digital Currency; Interest rate policy; Price-stability; Quantitative easing; Stock-flow dynamic model","","","","","","","","Benes X., Kumhof M., The Chicago Plan Revisited.

This paper uses the same framework to show that an identical result obtains in a world in which central banks issue digital currencies (CBDC) to be used abroad. I then integrate the asset pricing conditions into a fully-specified dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model to qualitatively study how shocks are transmitted across borders. In the baseline case, shock transmission is symmetric, whereas it is asymmetric if only one country issues international CBDC or crypto-assets are tied to one currency (stablecoin). I discuss policy implications for the ongoing debate on international aspects of CBDC. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.","CBDC; Cryptocurrency; Currency competition; Impossible trinity; Independent monetary policy","","","","","","","","Agur I., Ari A., Dell'Ariccia G., Designing central bank digital currencies, J.

Benefits of CBDC implementation heavily depend on its design, which, if not executed well, can lead to technological and privacy issues. Through case study examination, decision tree analysis, and IT system architecture modelling, this paper identifies key architectural and technological facets of retail CBDCs. We propose a decision-making methodology allowing policymakers to tailor CBDC design to their unique circumstances and requirements. In achieving this, we first outline core and optional CBDC properties and examine design choices from existing projects, form a list of assumptions affecting CBDC architecture and design, as well as vital design choices and trade-offs. Our research includes the development of 36 distinct IT architectures for CBDCs, demonstrating how different assumptions linked to policy objectives can influence the CBDC system design. These findings offer practical guidelines for policymakers, emphasizing the necessity to clearly define and prioritize policy objectives to form correct assumptions before applying our methodology. This approach helps to ensure that the CBDC design is optimally aligned with national economic goals and technological capabilities. © 2013 IEEE.","CBDC; central bank digital currency; decision-making methodology; design choices; IT architecture","Architecture; Computer architecture; Costs; Decision trees; Online systems; Sales; Central bank; Central bank digital currency; Currency; Decision making methodology; Decisions makings; Design choice; IT architecture; On-line banking; Privacy; Systems architecture; Economic and social effects","","","","","","","Auer R., Cornelli G., Frost J., Rise of the Central Bank Digital Currencies.

We used partial least squares structural equation modeling to investigate the nonlinear relationship between key national development indicators and central bank digital deployment across 67 countries. We explore the technological, environmental, legal, and economic factors that affect central bank digital currency adoption by country. We found a statistically significant and positive correlation between countries’ central bank digital currency adoption status and a country’s level of democracy and public confidence in governance, and a negative association between regulatory quality and income inequality. There was no significant association between countries’ central bank digital currency adoption status and their level of network readiness, foreign exchange reserves, and sustainable development goal rank. Thus, we posit that a country that is highly democratic and has good governance adopts central bank digital currencies more readily than others. Based on our findings, we suggested areas for additional research and highlighted policy considerations related to the wider adoption of central bank digital currency. © 2023 by the authors.","blockchain technology; central bank digital currency; fintech; macro-level adoption; SEM analysis","Electronic money; Environmental regulations; Least squares approximations; Nonlinear equations; Public policy; Sustainable development; Block-chain; Blockchain technology; Central bank; Central bank digital currency; Macro-level adoption; Monetary policies; Non-linear relationships; Partial least-squares; SEM analysis; Structural equation models; Blockchain","","","","","Universidad Rey Juan Carlos, URJC, (PREDOC22-001)","The study was supported by the Universidad Rey Juan Carlos (Ref: PREDOC22-001).","Yun J.H.J., Won D.K., Jeong E.S., Park K.B., Yang J.H., Park J.Y., The relationship between technology, business model, and market in autonomous car and intelligent robot industries, Technol.

As these currencies continue to play a larger role, they eventually will be an important component of banking system activity. Moreover, in addition to the standard role of financial intermediaries to facilitate lending, intermediaries can be valuable firms that help provide safekeeping of tokens. The objective of this paper is to demonstrate these important functions in a microfounded model of monetary exchange. Furthermore, we also consider the possibility that central banks issue their own digital currencies that may affect the level of intermediation in the private banking system. © 2023 The Ohio State University.","central bank digital currency; cryptocurrency; monetary policy","","","","","","","","Rao A., Uninsured Idiosyncratic Risk and Aggregate Saving, Quarterly Journal of Economics, 109, 3, pp. 658-694, (1994); Aiyagari S.R., Williamson S., Money and Dynamic Credit Arrangements with Private Information, Journal of Economic Theory, 91, pp. 248-279, (2000); David A., Assessing the Impact of Central Bank Digital Currency on Private Banks, Economic Journal, 131, pp. 525-540, (2021); Boragan A.S., Waller C., Wright R., Money and Capital, Journal of Monetary Economics, 58, pp. 98-116, (2011); Aleksander B., Camera G., Waller C., The Distribution of Money Balances and the Non-Neutrality of Money, International Economic Review, 46, pp. 465-487, (2005); Aleksander B., Camera G., Waller C., Money, Credit and Banking, Journal of Economic Theory, 135, pp. 171-195, (2007); Seyed D., Central Bank Digital Currency and Monetary Policy, Journal of Economic Dynamics and Control, 104, pp. 1-50, (2021); Peter A D., National Debt in a Neoclassical Growth Model, American Economic Review, 60, pp. 1126-1150, (1965); Jesus F.-V., Sanches D., Can Currency Competition Work?, Journal of Monetary Economics, 106, pp. 1-15, (2019); Ping H., Huang L., Wright R., Money and Banking in Search Equilibrium, International Economic Review, 46, pp. 637-670, (2005); Ping H., Huang L., Wright R., Money, Banking and Monetary Policy, Journal of Monetary Economics, 55, pp. 1013-1024, (2008); Charles K., McAndrews J., Roberds W., Money Is Privacy, International Economic Review, 46, pp. 377-399, (2005); Charles K., Roberds W., Credit and Identity Theft, Journal of Monetary Economics, 55, pp. 251-264, (2008); Kahn C., Rivadeneyra F., Wong T.-N., Eggs in One Basket: Security and Convenience of Digital Currencies, (2020); Keister T., Sanches D., Should Central Banks Issue Digital Currency?, (2022); Narayana K., Societal Benefits of Illiquid Bonds, Journal of Economic Theory, 108, pp. 179-193, (2003); Lagarde C., Panetta F., Report on a Digital Euro, (2020); Ricardo L., Wright R., A Unified Framework for Monetary Theory and Policy Analysis, Journal of Political Economy, 113, pp. 463-484, (2005); Antoine M., Schreft S., Currency Competition: A Partial Vindication of Hayek, Journal of Monetary Economics, 53, pp. 2085-2111, (2006); Daniel S., Williamson S., Money and Credit with Limited Commitment and Theft, Journal of Economic Theory, 145, pp. 1525-1549, (2010); Waller C., CBDC: A Solution in Search of a Problem?, (2021); Williamson S., Central Bank Digital Currency: Welfare and Policy Implications, (2021)","R.

Employing unique customer data hand-collected from German savings and cooperative banks, we generate conversion rates for deposits into a CBDC. Even at moderate conversion rates, most banks would have experienced funding problems and lost profits if a CBDC had been introduced in most years from 2000 onward. Our results are relevant for commercial banks, contributing to better assessments of the impact of CBDCs on liquidity and profitability and help central banks to identify implementation costs for banks within historical and hypothetical interest rate environments. © 2024 The Author(s)","Banking; Central bank digital currency; Digital money; Interbank market; Intermediation","","","","","","French Finance Association","\u2606 We thank two anonymous referees for constructive feedback and Stijn Claessens, J\u00F6rn Debener, Klaus Schaeck and Christoph Schneider for providing us with very helpful suggestions.

This study investigates how risks and benefits impact trust and the digital rupee (or CBDC) adoption in India. We use six perceived risk factors and four perceived benefits factors. The willingness to adopt the digital rupee can be significantly predicted by all the constructs except perceived usefulness. The study also shows the partial mediation effect of trust to bridge the impact of perceived risk on willingness. However, perceived ease of use, innovativeness, and inertia do not significantly impact trust to adopt the digital rupee. This study pioneers the literature on behavioral intention toward digital rupee adoption in India. The findings offer important implications for policymakers. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","CBDC; Digital currency; Digital rupee; FinTech; Perceived risk and benefit; Trust","","","","","","","","Abbassi W., Kumari V., Pandey D.K., What makes firms vulnerable to the Russia–Ukraine crisis?, J.

The findings revealed prevalent issues and objectives regarding digital payments in the region, as well as promising avenues for central bank involvement. However, it highlighted the challenges of creating a universal CBDC framework due to significant disparities among neighboring countries. Nonetheless, the collaborative research approach promises valuable insights for future efforts. To protect participant anonymity, each country's responses were anonymized with randomly assigned letters. The survey extensively examined awareness and understanding of CBDCs across diverse stakeholders in Latin American nations, including the general public, corporations, and financial institutions. These insights could shape educational campaigns and communication strategies, enabling policymakers and central banks to effectively share information about CBDCs. Moreover, this research effort sheds light on public perceptions, expectations, and concerns about CBDCs in Latin America. By exploring various dimensions such as awareness, interest, adoption potential, concerns, preferences, and regulatory considerations, the survey offers a comprehensive understanding of the CBDC landscape in the region. This holistic approach provides valuable insights for policymakers, central banks, and stakeholders to navigate the complexities of CBDC implementation effectively and responsibly. © 2024 The Author(s)","CBDC; Cross-border payments; Digital payments","","","","","","","","Arauz A., Garratt R., Diego F., Ramos F., Dinero electrónico: The rise and fall of Ecuador's central bank digital currency, Lat.

When a central bank is involved in financial intermediation, either directly through a central bank digital currency (CBDC) or indirectly through other policy instruments, it can only achieve two of three objectives: a socially efficient allocation, financial stability (i.e., absence of runs), and price stability. In particular, a commitment to price stability can cause a run on the central bank. Implementation of the socially optimal allocation requires a commitment to inflation. We illustrate this idea through a nominal version of the Diamond and Dybvig (1983) model. Our perspective may be particularly appropriate when CBDCs are introduced on a wide scale. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.","Bank runs; CBDC; Central bank digital currency; Currency crises; Financial intermediation; Inflation targeting; Monetary policy; Spending runs","","","","","","","","Allen F., Carletti E., Gale D., Money, financial stability and efficiency, J.

Agents have direct access to a CBDC, which is a claim on the central bank. They use both sight deposits and CBDC to buy goods and commercial banks borrow reserves to cover liquidity needs. The introduction of an interest-bearing CBDC has direct implications for the sight deposit rate and the loan rate of banks. Besides, if the central bank aims to have a positive net worth and the absence of bank runs, a high demand for a CBDC is a necessary condition to achieve both objectives. If this is not the case, financial stability will be endangered. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Bank runs; Banking sector; CBDC; Financial stability","","","","","","la Caixa” Foundation, (100010434)","I am grateful to the editor (Iftekhar Hasan) and two anonymous referees for their useful comments and suggestions.

People who are interested in the eNaira and financial inclusion will seek information about eNaira and financial inclusion. Their interest in information about eNaira and financial inclusion will make it easier for them to adopt the eNaira and embrace other financial inclusion innovations such as FinTech and cryptocurrency. This paper investigates the determinants of interest in eNaira and financial inclusion information. Design/methodology/approach: The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, correlation analysis and ordinary least squares (OLS) regression. The study also used the GMM and 2SLS regression methods for robustness. Findings: Using interest over time data, the findings of this study reveal that interest in financial technology (FinTech) and eNaira information are significant positive determinants of interest in financial inclusion information. Also, interest in financial inclusion is a significant positive determinant of interest in eNaira information. Furthermore, interest in FinTech information has a positive and significant correlation with interest in financial inclusion information. There is also a significant positive correlation between interest in central bank digital currency information and interest in FinTech information. The implication of the findings is that interest in information about new financial innovations, such as FinTech and eNaira, can stimulate interest in information about financial inclusion. Originality/value: The literature has not examined the determinants of interest in eNaira and financial inclusion information yet. © 2022, Peterson K.

The public’s preferences concerning the usage of CBDC for paying and saving are important determinants of the success of CBDC. However, little is known yet about consumers’ attitudes towards CBDC. Using data from a representative panel of Dutch consumers we find that roughly half of the public says it would open a CBDC current account. The same holds for a CBDC savings account. Thus, we find clear potential for CBDC in the Netherlands. This suggests that consumers perceive CBDC as distinct from current and savings accounts offered by traditional banks. Intended CBDC usage is positively related to respondents’ knowledge of CBDC and trust in the central bank. Price incentives matter as well. The amount respondents say they would want to deposit in the CBDC savings account depends on the interest rate offered. Furthermore, intended usage of the CBDC current account is highest among people who find privacy and security important and among consumers with low trust in banks in general. These results suggest that central banks can steer consumers’ adoption of CBDC via the interest rate, by a design of CBDC that takes into account the public’s need for security and privacy, and by clear communication about what CBDC entails. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Bank accounts; CBDC; Consumers; Private money; Public money; Trust","","","","","","ESCB; European Central Bank High Level Taskforce on CBDC","We would like to thank colleagues at DNB for helpful comments on earlier versions of this paper and the questionnaire.

Design/methodology/approach: The paper used conceptual discourse analysis to explain the role of CBDC in bank earnings management. Findings: Banks will use accruals, such as LLPs, to manage earnings when CBDC-induced bank disintermediation leads to a reduction in bank deposits, a reduction in bank lending and a likely reduction in reported earnings. Bank managers will mitigate the reduction in reported earnings by lowering discretionary LLPs to increase reported earnings. Originality/value: The recent emergence of CBDC in the digital currency universe has led to increased research interest on the role of CBDC in corporations and society. This study contributes to the literature by focusing on banks, and examining the effect of CBDC on bank earnings management. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Accruals; Banks; Central bank digital currency;

In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, CBDCs’ promises to reduce personal contact, facilitate socially desirable use of money, and initiate more targeted monetary measures have increased their popularity. In addition, CBDCs can potentially serve as a tool to internationalize a sovereign’s currency. World central banks, thus, have gradually formulated a consensus on structuring CBDCs, leaving the regulatory aspects of CBDCs deserving more attention. Among the regulatory issues related to CBDCs, observers often mentioned their association with privacy concerns, but comprehensive studies on this aspect of CBDCs remain limited. In this paper, we discuss the privacy concerns associated with CBDCs and attempt to introduce discipline upon CBDCs and their issuing central banks. We first demonstrate the privacy implications of CBDCs and highlight the risks that issuing sovereigns misuse CBDCs to serve their agendas. We then discuss, in a domestic context, several architectural designs proclaimed to address CBDCs’ privacy concerns and propose further disciplinary mechanisms that may credibly enforce privacy protection laws against issuing central banks and other governmental authorities. We finally highlight the extraterritorial character of modern privacy laws, which allows foreign privacy protection regulators to discipline the CBDCs of other sovereigns. Through this analysis, we argue that applying modern privacy laws with proper supporting mechanisms may effectively discipline CBDCs and their issuing central banks. © 2023, Northwestern University School of Law.

CBDC has the potential to be a game challenger in the international financial system, bringing increased complexities arising from technology and regulatory considerations, as well as generating greater currency competition. As more states begin exploring CBDC, the interactions between actors may lead to the emergence of a new CBDC network. What shape would the emerging CBDC network take? What would its network effects be? What would be the impact of the CBDC network on the international financial system, or the global financial network? This article explores these questions by examining the emerging CBDC network and its regulatory implications. It argues that the CBDC network would likely be both decentralized and uncoordinated, making it unlikely to lead to convergence in CBDC regulation. The CBDC network would probably bring policy diffusion effects, with states behaving instrumentally, while shaking up the power balance between different actors, generating both cooperation and conflict. The CBDC network also has the potential to push international financial system toward becoming more decentralized. © 2023 The Authors.

Based on the distributed ledger technology and other financial technology, CBDC could improve the efficiency of domestic and cross-border payments, increase payment safety and soundness, and promote financial inclusion. However, it is argued that the introduction of CBDC would threaten data security and invade personal privacy. Currently, this issue has received growing concern, and some recommendations are proposed by countries or international organizations, like privacy design, restrictions on public authorities and payment intermediaries, and establishing independent supervisory authority. Other suggestions include getting countries involved in international coordination and promoting the formation of unified standards. Among major economies, China is the first to launch CBDC, which is known as e-CNY. Based on an overview of the privacy protection legislation in China, this article attempts to describe the rules that should be followed when dealing with personal data generated in e-CNY circulation. © 2023, Yijun Institute of International Law.

The launch of the digital rupee represents a significant advancement in the “Digital India” revolution. It will be a fantastic opportunity for India since it might make conducting business easier while enhancing the security and resilience of the overall payments system. Digital currency attempts to rapidly progress monetary policy to disrupt physical money, lower the cost of financial transactions, and reshape how the money will circulate. Although the effects of digital currency cannot be foreseen, it is extremely important to thoroughly research digital currency and its effects on the operational stage. The development of a digital currency infrastructure has some challenges in terms of performance, scalability, and different usage scenarios. The article clarifies what e₹ is. How does it work?

At the same time, the embodiment of the competitive balance between “electronic private and digital honest” for the interaction of the information society in a virtual environment, which makes it possible to turn the lack of understanding (indirect participation) into a trust relationship (direct participation) with full optional financial support in the contour of the national metaverse, has not yet been implemented in practice. The relevance and desirability of the study is due to insufficient research on the integration of high-tech financial products into the monetary system in the focus of a full-scale digital transformation of the entire financial system, as well as the lack of a carefully developed legal framework for the implementation of central banks digital currencies on a global scale. The need to achieve this goal determined a phased study of regulatory, statistical and periodic literature using general scientific and special research methods: systemic and interdisciplinary approaches, formal logic, comparative analysis, classification, etc. The authors have found that the digital ruble does not correspond to the category of ideal digital currency in the context of digital (crypto) units and identified the discussion provisions for regulating the transformation processes of the digital ruble implementation into monetary turnover.

The key moment was the introduction of virtual currencies into monetary systems and payment turnover. The circulation of cryptocurrencies along with fiat money in the global economy has created paradoxical situations that require research both scientific, theoretical and applied context. The subject of the study is the payment functionality of digital currencies. The purpose of the study is to explore the possibility of using cryptocurrencies and central bank digital currencies (CBDC) for cross-border payments within the existing traditional financial system, both in the general context and with the application of sanctions restrictions that hamper international settlements in traditional methods. In the process of research, content analysis, retrospective analysis, methods of logical and comparative analysis were used. This study is one of the first to explore the possibility of using bitcoin in cross-border payments under sanctions restrictions. It is shown that the volatility of cryptocurrencies is the most important characteristic that limits their use as payment instruments, but this risk can be neutralized by using cryptocurrency as a transit instrument, as a temporary intermediary in the exchange of fiat currencies. The conclusion is made about the possibility of using cryptocurrencies as a transit instrument in the implementation of exports and imports settlements in toxic currencies of unfriendly countries, and to use the Central Bank Digital Currencies in cross-border settlements within the framework of integration and non-integration interstate associations with the participation of Russia. © Krylova L.V., 2024.","bitcoin; CBDC; cross-border payments; cryptocurrencies; digital currencies; fiat currencies","","","","","","","","LocalBitcoins ceased operations, it banned the registration of new accounts, and on February 16 stopped trading and limited the functions of the wallet, leaving only the withdrawal of funds; Cryptocurrencies: trends, risks, measures.

Furthering the work of Agarwal, Agarwal, Agarwal and Agarwal (2018) where the introduction of Digital Rupee as CBDC issuance the launch of pilot project by RBI (e₹-R) and the steps to bank the unbanked through the Jan-Dhan Accounts, JAM Trinity and the need for CBDC wallets for a strong measure of Financial Inclusion, the literature review synthesis has been done.

As fintech has been popular in many countries, there is very little understanding on how successful it has performed in India for financial inclusion. This research attempts to ravel important factors that may or may not have a direct or indirect impact on fintech innovation for financial inclusion, thereby dissecting the empirical data to reveal important information for the reader. Design/methodology/approach: This study covers a comprehensive literature review, from which key variables are discovered, then develops hypotheses to be examined, followed by proposing a research model. The survey data examines important research instruments for fintech inclusion in India, identifying and measuring factors, leading to partial least squares (PLS) model testing. Finally, the key findings are reported. Findings: The findings reveal that fintech innovation from variables such as users experience and motivation for digital payments drives usefulness and ease of use leading to financial inclusion. The security, trust, transparency and customer support when built into the fintech innovation for digital payments influences perceived ease of use (PEOU) and usefulness that mediates to uplift financial inclusion directly. Whereas perceived usefulness (PU) anchoring happens to be a precursor for the financial inclusion. On the contrary, cultural values for fintech innovation through PEOU and usefulness had no impact whatsoever on financial inclusion, thus demystifying cultural influences as non-influential factor. Research limitations/implications: Research limitations are that the study was conducted in India, and may not be generalised in other countries; however, it can be modified to fit future research. Survey data captured was from a particular region of South India, which may differ from the rest of the country. The sample size and research period were adequate; however, larger data sets would be more meaningful for longitudinal studies. As India is the second most populous country in the world, a comparison with other similar countries of the same size and geographical location will be useful for future research. Practical implications: This research reveals that financial inclusion is much more complex than previously known and that the penetration of fintech has the capacity to go deeper and include a large number of people into the mainstream financial system and ameliorate the inequities in urban-rural gender and caste. The user’s experience, culture and motivations positively influenced the usefulness and ease of use for driving the financial inclusion of digital payments. Further security, trust, transparency and customer support can facilitate the use of central bank digital currency (CBDC) as a tool for financial inclusion. Social implications: Fintech innovation for financial inclusion is based on the successful acceptance of the digital payment system by people in the society. This research has identified that for any fintech innovation, it is essential that society needs to benefit from it. Encouraging a larger population to switch to digital payments offer challenges and opportunities. While the opportunities are enormous research suggests that early adopters of new technology go through different phases of testing, in which a society can completely accept an innovation or can completely reject an innovation if the two mediating factors such as PU and ease of use do not perform as predicted, thus having a higher failure rate. On the other side, if such an innovation as fintech becomes successful it has the capacity to bring billions of people into mainstream financial inclusion, a success story that can greatly benefit the Indian society and which can be replicated among other countries in the world. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this study is the first attempt in an effort to understand the influential factors from the point of view of users for the adoption of CBDC for financial inclusion. The main contribution of this paper is to examine the role of CBDC as an instrument to foster financial inclusion in India, which has not been attempted so far. The originality also lies to the heart of the research is dissecting and making meaningful sense of the empirical data, developing and measuring research instruments and hypotheses and finally adopting a PLS model to answer the key research question, which is whether fintech innovation for financial inclusion can be successful for India? © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Central bank digital currency; Digital payments; Financial inclusion; Fintech; Innovation","","","","","","","","Abdullah F., Ward R., Ahmed E., Investigating the influence of the most commonly used external variables of TAM on students’ perceived ease of use (PEOU) and perceived usefulness (PU) of e-portfolios, Computers in Human Behavior, 63, pp. 75-90, (2016); Agardi I., Alt A.M., Do digital natives use mobile payment differently than digital immigrants?

We analyse the factors which are contributing to de- dollarization. On the economic front, there is reduced fiscal and financial capacity of the US economy that can strain economic trust in the dollar. The internationalization of the Chinese currency is another factor. Additionally, a lower forecast for the world economic growth outlook, a higher debt financing in the United States, and a war in Europe are also leading to central banks around the world buying more gold and reducing investment in the US treasury bonds. While these factors may lead to reduced demand for dollars and increase the use of alternate international currencies, including digital currencies, we argue that dislodging the dollar as a global anchor currency is at best going to be restricted by economic and geopolitical reasons.

Specifically, we advance a theoretical model in which introducing an interest-bearing CBDC expands market participants' payment and investment options but also poses a potential threat to financial intermediaries if it raises their borrowing costs significantly. The existence of a network externality further complicates the analysis by affecting consumers' choice of payment mechanism. Our results suggest that the issuance of a CBDC is a double-edged sword for an economy. Although it provides additional payment and investment options for market participants, it increases competition and weakens financial intermediaries' margins. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.","Central bank digital currency; Financial stability; Interest rate; Payment instrument","","","","","","Jonathan Batten; Korea America Finance Association; Korean Association of Financial Engineering; Korean Financial Management Association; Northern Kentucky University, NKU; RMIT University, RMIT; Ministry of Education, MOE; National Research Foundation of Korea, NRF, (NRF-2022S1A5A2A01044485); Chinese University of Hong Kong, CUHK","We appreciate valuable comments from Brian Lucey (Editor-in-Chief), Jonathan Batten (RMIT University), Chanik Jo (Chinese University of Hong Kong), Young Sang Kim (Northern Kentucky University), and all participants from the 2023 Joint International Conference on Finance organized by the Korean Financial Management Association (KFMA), the Korean Association of Financial Engineering (KAFE), and the Korea America Finance Association (KAFA).

CBDCs in developing countries has a wider impact on potential to bank large unbanked populations and boost financial inclusion in conjunction with the JAM Trinity. Agarwal, Agarwal, Agarwal and Agarwal (2018) proposed the introduction of Digital Rupee as CBDC issuance, which can be done by change of mode, instead of minting. The study focuses to study the perception & usefulness of Digital Rupee in India with over 997 respondents from across disciplines, age groups, genders pan India. The general belief is that Digital Rupee introduced as CBDC by RBI will increase overall lending, engulf unbanked population, help credit-building, increase transactional efficiency & reduce ills of crypto-products. The design is optimal for welfare as the gains from greater access to CBDC outweigh the contraction it holds today. © Indian Institute of Finance","Bank; CBDC; Deposit; Digital Rupee, RBI, India; Financial Inclusion; Monetary Policy; Money; Money Supply","","","","","","","","Intelligent blocks of India's future workforce, Report by Accenture, August 6Th, (2018); Pacific Energy Update 2018, Asian Development Bank, Manila, (2018); Adrian T., Mancini Griffoli T., ""The Rise of Digital Money"" Fintech Notes No. 19/001, International Monetary Fund, Washington DC, (2019); Adrian T., Grinberg F., Mancini-Griffoli T., Townsend& R., Zhang N., The rise of digital money: A strategic plan to continue delivering on the IMF's mandate, IMF Workingpaper22/217, (2022); AFI Members Explore Central Bank Digital Currency Opportunities, AFI Global, 16 November, (2020); Interjection on Bank Depository Insurance Act & Bitcoins, (2017); Agarwal A., Crypto Currency impacting Global Financial System, Discussion with Prof. Joseph Stglitz (Nobei Laureate & Professor Columbia University) after His Address at India Economic Conclave 2018 at Taj Palace Diplomat Hotel, Delhi at 10:55 Am, (2018); Agarwal A., BITCOINS, Crypto Currencies & Global Financial Markets Crash, Delhi Doordarshan TV (DD India TV), March 11^*,2018 at 6:00 PM, (2018); Agarwal Aman, Comments & Question on Bitcoins & Crypto Currency, (2018); Agarwal A., World Financial Markets & Crypto Currencies, Delhi Doordarshan TV (DD India TV), February 18Th, 2018 at 6:00 PM and Delhi Doordarshan TV (DD News TV), February 19Th, 2018 at 10:00 am (Youtu.Be/ Adildt2-Kug), (2018); Agarwal A., Penm J.H.W., Agarwal S., ""Common Currency for India and the ASEAN Region : An Empirical Investigation"", Working Paper, (2006); Agarwal A., Penm J.H.W., Wong W.-K., Martin L.M., ""ASEAN DOLLAR : A Common Currency Establishment for Stronger Economic Growth of ASEAN Region"" Finance India, (2004); Agarwal J.D., Agarwal M., Agarwal A., Agarwal Y., Bala Kashi R., Economics of Cri/ptocurrencies: Artificial Intelligence, Blockchain, and Digital Currency, World Scientific Book Chapters, In: NYU Stern School of Business, Prof., 13, pp. 331-430, (2020); Agarwal J.D., Agarwal A., Money Laundering : The Real Estate Bubble"", Finance India, Vol 22 No 1, March 2008, Invited to Deliver the Address to the AFFI (French Finance Association) Annual Meeting June 2007 on Finance, Ethics and Governance Organized by the University of Bordeaux IV, Bordeaux and AFFI, (France) at the Annual Meeting International Conference in Bordeaux, FRANCE (June 27-29Th, (2008); Agarwal J.D., Agarwal A., India AML Progress Analyzed, USA Patriot Act Monitor, August, (2004); Agarwal J.D., Agarwal A., International Money Laundering in the Banking Sector, Finance India, Vol XVIII No 2, June 2004; Reprinted with Permission in the 1CFAI Journal of Banking Law, Vol. II No. 4, October 2004, the Journal of ICFAI University, Hyderabad.

While these pilot projects have confirmed the feasibility of using DLT platforms for large-value wholesale payments, it is not yet clear whether these platforms will provide major advantages in terms of speed and scalability for small-value/large-volume retail payments. In Turkey, the existing instant payment system has already demonstrated that it can settle as many as 1,980 transactions per second (TPS) and 11.5 million transactions per day, across its 25 participant institutions. Moreover, simulations in test conditions suggest that it has the potential to deliver thousands of transactions per second, and that it is scalable to hundreds of participant institutions. Any retail payment system built on a DLT platform must therefore, at the very least, perform at a comparable level. Using actual retail payment data from the day on which the peak TPS was observed, this paper describes a novel experimental investigation into the TPS and scalability performance of two open source DLT platforms (Hyperledger Fabric and Quorum) and Turkey’s instant payment system for retail pay-ments, with the aim of providing valuable insights for the design of alternatives for future CBDC launches. The study presents several empirical findings. First, it demonstrates that the speed and scalability of selected DLT platforms are not yet mature enough to establish an enterprise retail payment solution. Secondly, the experimental design enables us to determine precisely which DLT platform is facing a performance and capacity bottleneck and under what circumstances. One of the most critical findings is that platforms with a modular architecture and more efficient transaction life cycle perform relatively better, although still lack the requirements for achieving reliable and efficient retail payments. Lastly, we suggest that it could be worth developing an integrated approach in which the central instant payment system and DLT-based digital currency solution communicate via a bridge platform. © Henry Stewart Publications, 1750-1806.","central bank digital currency; distributed ledger technology; instant payment system","","","","","","","","Waller C.

We find that central banks’ sentiment toward CBDC shifted positively following increased losses from cyberattacks on crypto assets, which implies that central banks believe CBDC could be a public solution to protect consumers from risks arising from the private sector. However, their sentiment toward CBDC significantly declined following more active cyberwarfare attacks, which could pose systematic risks to the national financial system. © 2022","Central bank digital currency; Crypto assets; Cyberattacks; Cybersecurity risks","","","","","","","","Adrian T., Mancini-Griffoli T., The Rise of Digital Money, (2019); Auer R., Cornelli G., Frost J., Rise of the Central Bank Digital Currencies: Drivers, Approaches and Technologies, (2020); Auer R., Frost J., Gambacorta L., Monnet C., Rice T., Shin H.S., Central Bank Digital Currencies: Motives, Economic Implications and the Research Frontier, (2021); Caporale G.M., Kang W.Y., Spagnolo F., Spagnolo N., Non-linearities, cyberattacks and cryptocurrencies, Financ.

However, the current research on CBDCs is more at the technical and economic level, with few studies conducted on the user experience (UX) of CBDCs. This work examines the impact of dynamic page interaction effects and multimodal operational feedback on the CBDC UX. This work is a 3 (dynamic page interaction) × 4 (multimodal operational feedback) mixed factorial design to evaluate the impact of the study variables on users' task performance and subjective evaluations. The experimental results show that dynamic page interactions and multimodal operational feedback influence the user task performance of a CBDC. Moreover, the CBDC interface with dynamic page interaction and multimodal operational feedback is rated higher regarding user usability. In addition, the tactile feedback may be related to the CBDC user recommendation index. Finally, although dynamic page interactions have higher user preferences than non-dynamic ones, they may bring users less of a sense of security. The above findings could provide theoretical support for national central banks preparing to issue CBDCs, and have positive implications for the future development of the CBDC UX. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","CBDC; Central bank digital currencies; Dynamic page interactions; Multimodal operation prompts; User experience","User interfaces; Central bank; Central bank digital currency; Dynamic page interaction; Dynamic pages; Multi-modal; Multimodal operation; Multimodal operation prompt; Users' experiences; Electronic money","","","","","","","Agur I., Ari A., Dell'Ariccia G., Designing central bank digital currencies, J.

This paper finds that it is not possible to introduce such a system under the ECB’s monetary mandate. The aim of direct access is to promote the socio-economic inclusion of the unbanked. This aim is not monetary but economic. Therefore such an introduction should be in accordance with the economic mandate of the ECB. This paper first analyses the legal foundation in “Legal foundation” section upon which CBDC can be introduced. It finds that it is possible to introduce CBDC based upon the ECB’s authority to issue legal tender. However, this would not provide a sufficient foundation to provide for direct access. Nor does article 17 of the ESCB Statutes provide the legal foundation for direct access. New legislation would have to be drafted for the ECB to introduce a CBDC system with direct consumer access. Even with this new legal foundation, the ECB would have to comply with its economic mandate. This article first analyses the extent of the economic mandate in “Framework” section. It then continues by discussing the aim of the economic mandate in “Aim” section. It finds that the socio-economic inclusion of unbanked is an aim consistent with the Treaties. The aim of general purpose CBDC, therefore, complies with the ECB’s economic mandate. The paper in “Efficient allocation of resources” section then discusses the criterion of efficient allocation of resources. It finds that the introduction of general purpose CBDC does not comply with this criterion. When introducing CBDC with direct access through NCBs the ECB is competing with commercial banks. This competition should be considered unfair based upon the ECB’s exclusive power to issue legal tender and the public status of NCBs. Since the issue of unbanked in the EU is limited and decreasing, there is not enough reason to consider offering a bank account as a Service of General Economic Interest. The introduction of directly accessible general purpose CBDC would therefore be unlawful. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.","Central Bank Digital Currency; Digital euro; Economic policy; European Central Bank; Secondary objectives","","","","","","","","","A.M.

It assesses if CBDC policy should be guided by consumer data. The evaluation covers consumer willingness to pay (WTP), the influence of individual CBDC perceptions, mediation of social advantages and infrastructure views, and the role of consumer attributes. Data from 1308 Chinese respondents were collected via an online survey. A structural equation model examines WTP for China's CBDC (DCEP). Findings reveal significant WTP for DCEP, with noteworthy causal, mediation, and moderation effects. Positive individual perceptions enhance WTP, and consumer traits shape these relationships. Notably, perceiving individual CBDC benefits impacts WTP positively, while perceiving drawbacks dampens it. Consumers valuing CBDC's social advantages are more likely to adopt it, but this doesn't apply to infrastructure perceptions. Various consumer attributes moderate these dynamics, emphasizing the importance of consumer data in shaping CBDC strategies. Policy suggestions include tailored advertising, privacy measures, regulations, and usage strategies to ensure CBDC sustainability. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.","Central bank digital currencies; Consumer data; Digital currency electronic payment; Sustainable operation management policies","Central bank; Central bank digital currency; Consumer data; Digital currency electronic payment; Electronic payment; Management policy; Operation management; Sustainable operation management policy; Sustainable operations; Willingness to pay; banking; central bank; consumption behavior; investment; policy implementation; technological development; Electronic money","","","","","National Office for Philosophy and Social Sciences, NPOPSS, (18ZDA093)","This study was supported by the National Social Science Fund of China (Grant No. 18ZDA093 ).

CBDC refers to a digital currency issued by the central bank that holds the same legal status as physical cash. The primary objective of CBDC as an alternative legal tender is to coexist harmoniously with physical currency, offering individuals the choice of CBDC as a legal tender for those who prefer digital currencies. Given the increasing reliance on technology in our daily lives, the acceptance of digital currency to facilitate transactions has become crucial for society. Therefore, understanding the factors influencing an individual's intention to adopt electronic money is of paramount importance. The research design employed in this study is quantitative with a descriptive approach. The research was conducted in Makassar City, South Sulawesi, Indonesia. The sample size was determined using Slovin's formula, with a 10% margin of error, resulting in a sample size of 99.9 samples. However, due to fractional subject numbers, it was rounded up to 100 samples. The data analysis technique used is multiple regression. To strengthen the research findings, the control variables gender, education, and age were used. The research findings indicate the following: (1) Attitude significantly and positively impacts the implementation of CBDC; (2) subjective norms have a significant negative impact on the implementation of CBDC; (3) perceived behavioral control (PBC) significantly impacts the implementation of CBDC; (4) the control variables gender, education, and age are correlated with the three TPB variables. © 2024 GMP Press and Printing.","Central Bank Digital Currency; Planned behavior theory","","","","","","","","Ajzen I., Fishbein M., Understanding attitudes and predicting social behavior, (1980); Ajzen I., The Theory of Planned Behavior, Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 50, 2, pp. 179-211, (1991); Ajzen I., Fishbein M., The influence of attitudes on behavior, The handbook of attitudes, (2005); Bai X., Examining factors influencing behavioral intention to adopt centralized digital currencies (CDC): An empirical study based on the integrated model of UTAUT2 and TPB, (2020); Chen Chun-Lung, Lai Wen-Hsiang, Exploring the Impact of Perceived Risk on User’s Mobile Payment Adoption, Review of Integrative Business and Economics Research, 12, 1, pp. 1-20, (2023); Dinh H.

While most of the recent activity (papers, pilots, etc) in the field of central bank digital currency (CBDC) has focused on the potential advantages for central banks and on the technology (ledgers, platforms, etc), a more appropriate starting point is to identify what problems CBDC is intended to solve, especially for the affected stakeholders. At the end of the evaluation, focus on technological solutions should commence only once business and policy goals have been iden-tified. After a quick summary of the motivations for central banks, regulators, governments and pol-icymakers, the paper examines the motivations for the other key stakeholders in the ecosystem — an aspect that has to date been insufficiently examined. The paper then comments on the challenges asso-ciated with driving consumer adoption of CBDC, before discussing the microeconomic disincentives for CBDC adoption among commercial banks, along-side the macroeconomic necessity.The paper concludes with some thoughts on how to balance the conflicting interest of the many stakeholders and the lessons one can learn from other large-scale payment initiatives. © 2023, Henry Stewart Publications.

In the current age of digital transformation, to be followed perhaps by a quantum transformation in computing, plus the involvement of central banks, resource scarcity and climate change, this is the issue addressed in the article. Financial transactions are central to digitalization through fintech and other services. This conceptual article highlights the essentials of cryptocurrency, its history, structure and how it works. Different types of cryptocurrency mining will be examined and explained in detail. The primary purpose of this research is to investigate the extent to which cryptocurrency structure complies with the maxims of Islamic finance. The article discusses the question in relation to sharia jurisprudence and conformity with the views of Islamic finance scholars. Our discussion extends the rapidly growing literature on cryptocurrency by examining its compatibility with the conceptions of Mal (‘money’) in sharia and Islamic scholarship and its status as fiat money. Taking the view that despite recent glitches, cryptocurrency has a future in the financial ecosystem, we sketch the challenges of facing the introduction of cryptocurrency into Islamic finance. © 2023 Intellect Ltd Article.

Therefore, this study constructs a six-sector dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model to analyze whether the coevolution of central bank digital currency (CBDC) and green bonds can fully play a positive role in promoting the net-zero economy. The results indicate that: (i) Increased CBDC supply has a positive effect on the economy, and also promotes green bond financing and net-zero emissions. (ii) Compared with non-interest-bearing CBDC, the coevolution of interest-bearing CBDC and green bonds is more likely to promote the net-zero economy and enhance the effectiveness of monetary policy. (iii) When the economy is overheating or in recession, the central bank can regulate green bond financing by adjusting the CBDC interest rate to promote a net-zero economy. (iv) The coevolution of interest-bearing CBDC and green bonds will achieve a higher welfare level than non-interest-bearing CBDC. This study provides guidance for the coevolution of CBDC technology innovation and green bond financial innovation. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.","Central bank digital currency (CBDC); Coevolution effect; Green bond; Net-zero economy","Air pollution; Economic and social effects; Electronic money; Finance; Stochastic models; Bond financing; Central bank; Central bank digital currency; Co-evolution; Coevolution effect; Financial tools; Green bond; Green economies; Net-zero economy; Zero emission; central bank; currency; finance; general equilibrium analysis; monetary policy; stochasticity; welfare economics; Stochastic systems","","","","","National Planning Office of Philosophy and Social Science, NOPSS, (21BJY206); National Planning Office of Philosophy and Social Science, NOPSS","This work was supported by the National Planning Office of Philosophy and Social Science of China (Grant No. 21BJY206).","Agur I., Ari A., Dell'Ariccia G., Designing central bank digital currencies, J.

And yet, little attention has been paid to the European Central Bank (ECB)'s accountability in the process of adoption and beyond. This article attempts to fill this void. It argues that the concept of ‘independent accountability’, still prevalent regarding monetary policy, is an inappropriate standard to hold the ECB accountable for its decisions on the digital euro for at least three reasons. First, while the ECB has the power to issue a digital euro with cash-like features, its mandate is not clear-cut, nor are its decisions merely technical in nature. Second, the digital euro affects areas in which the ECB has no specific expertise or authority, such as privacy, and its adoption requires an unprecedented level of coordination with the EU legislators. And third, it is not only public authorities with which the ECB must engage, but also market actors and citizens to ensure the digital euro's success. What emerges is a new accountability standard, with a broader range of ‘accountability stakeholders’ and a stronger role for ex ante consultations. © The Author(s) 2024.","accountability; banknotes; Central Bank Digital Currency; digital euro; European Central Bank; independence; monetary policy; payments","","","","","","","","","S.

From a theoretical perspective, the introduction of a CBDC arouses long-standing questions, foreseeing the possibility for the private (non-financial) sector to access the central bank reserves. The aim of this paper is to strengthen the understanding of the CBDC through the Endogenous Money Theory (EMT). The paper examines the balance sheets of the central bank, commercial banks, and the non-financial private system, tracking all the assets and liabilities of the macro-agents involved in the introduction of a CBDC. It explains the logical chain of relationships starting with the creation of bank loans from commercial banks, transformed into deposits, and ultimately converted into CBDC. Such a chain of relationships is also explained by amending the four quadrants model proposed by many post-Keynesian scholars. © 2023 The Authors","CBDC; Central Bank; Commercial Banks; Cryptocurrencies; Endogenous money","","","","","","","","Allen F., Gu X., Jagtiani J., Fintech, cryptocurrencies, and CBDC: Financial structural transformation in China, J.

The remuneration scheme plays a significant role only in the moderate/capped adoption scenario in relative terms and in a high interest rate environment.

Bitcoin’s founding document (the Whitepaper) was released to the world on 31 October 2008 by Satoshi Nakamoto, who disappeared forever on 10 December 2010. In each of its stages over more than 40 years of evolution, the financial freedom of the individual was always present in its structure and backbone, as a fundamental right that every human being has. Now, the Central Banks, on the back of the success and firm takeover of the “cryptographic” and economic market by the currency created by Satoshi, intend to apply with haste a program of gradual implementation worldwide for their digital currencies, a strategy that is already well underway in countries such as China, Panama or Nigeria. This paper discusses central bank digital cryptocurrencies (CBDC), as opposed to Bitcoin, with their legal implications: the public faith of the blockchain, the jurisprudence surrounding bitcoin, the (lack of) accountability of central banks, the dangers of centralisation and concentration of decision-making power, the loss of privacy and anonymity, and the need to talk about Law in Metaverse. © 2024, UNIV CARLOSIII MADRID.

China is then used as a case study to explore how blockchain technology is adopted to enable central bank digital currency, bond tokenization, and “currency bridge”. Based on various contexts analyzed, we extend the Technology Acceptance Model, highlighting the roles of perceived benefits, perceived risks, and collaborative leadership in building trust in and promoting adoption of tokenization.

It is based on physical cash and online transactions. Central bank digital currencies strive to tackle the difficulties that afflict the current economic system by providing total transparency of the money supply. As opposed to completely decentralized cryptocurrencies, central bank-issued digital currencies are the most centralized. However, centralization will be advantageous in terms of money programmability, improved transparency, and financial crime monitoring. Before digital currencies can be widely used, a strong security framework, data protection, and effective governance will be required. Major central banks around the world are exploring technologies and methodologies to deploy their own version of digital currency that can coexist with the current physical cash and in near future replace the traditional form of value transfer. It can be promising for enhancing the economic outreach of a country and releasing a broad range of possibilities when it comes to financial inclusion and ease of transactions. CBDCs will not only help in easing payments but will help in government fund disbursements directly to eligible individuals without the interference of an intermediary bank, frictionless and faster value transfer, and exploring new financial mechanisms. These systems to support the CBDC architecture will require a robust security system that can be used for secure payments but the system design should also be simple and flexible enough to accommodate future design changes. © 2023 Little Lion Scientific.

In the benchmark model with only CBDC, entrepreneurs can deposit their idle CBDC and banks can hold CBDC to satisfy the reserve requirement. CBDC and bank deposits become complements. A higher CBDC interest rate always promotes investment and may or may not reduce bank lending, because the higher return on CBDC encourages entrepreneurs to accumulate more CBDC and deposit more. More deposits could in turn lead to more bank lending. The interest rate on reserves and the reserve requirement ratio can be effective policy tools that affect bank lending and investment. We consider extensions where cash and interest-bearing CBDC can coexist. The coexistence may require the central bank to adjust the CBDC interest rate or the interest rate on reserves. Our results suggest that the relationship between CBDC and bank deposits are crucial for understanding the effects of CBDC on banking and the macroeconomy. © 2024 The Author(s)","Banking; CBDC; Idle liquidity; Interest rates; Investment","central bank; currency; interest rate; investment; macroeconomics","","","","","Econometric Society; Central Bank; seminars of UC; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (72073006)","The authors make equal contributions to the paper.

Design/methodology/approach: This study used critical discourse analysis to identify the benefits and risks of CBDC, Fintech and cryptocurrency for financial inclusion and financial stability. Findings: Fintech, CBDC and cryptocurrency can increase financial inclusion by providing an alternative channel through which unbanked adults can access formal financial services. CBDC and Fintech services have the potential to preserve financial stability, while cryptocurrency presents financial stability risks that can be mitigated through effective regulation. This paper also identified some problems of CBDC, Fintech and cryptocurrency for financial inclusion and financial stability. This paper offered some insight about the future of financial inclusion and the future of financial stability. Practical implications: Although CBDC, Fintech or cryptocurrency can extend financial services to unbanked adults and offer cost-efficient advantages, there are risk considerations that need to be taken into account when using CBDC, Fintech and cryptocurrency to increase financial inclusion and to preserve financial stability. Originality/value: The literature has not identified the combined role of CBDC, Fintech and cryptocurrency for financial inclusion and financial stability. To the best of the author’s knowledge, this paper is the first paper to assess the combined role of CBDC, Fintech and cryptocurrency for financial inclusion and financial stability. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Blockchain; CBDC; Central bank digital currency; Cryptocurrency; Financial inclusion; Financial stability; Fintech","","","","","","","","Allen F., Gu X., Jagtiani J., Fintech, cryptocurrencies, and CBDC: financial structural transformation in China, Journal of International Money and Finance, 124, (2022); Allen S., Capkun S., Eyal I., Fanti G., Ford B.A., Grimmelmann, Juels A., Kostiainen K., Meiklejohn S., Miller A., Prasad E., Design choices for Central bank digital currency: policy and technical considerations, (2020); Arner D.W., Zetzsche D.A., Buckley R.P., Barberis J.N., FinTech and RegTech: enabling innovation while preserving financial stability, Georgetown Journal of International Affairs, 18, 3, pp. 47-58, (2017); Auer R., Bohme R., The technology of retail Central bank digital currency, BIS Quarterly Review, March, pp. 85-100, (2020); Avgouleas E., Regulating financial innovation: a multifaceted challenge to financial stability, consumer protection and growth, Oxford Handbook of Financial Regulation, (2015); Bateman M., Be careful what you wish for: the spectacular rise of Fintech.

Through a decentralized peer-to-peer network, users can create shared databases, resulting in a trustworthy and aggregated database known as a blockchain that enhances reliability and security. The distributed nature of the blockchain enables data to be stored on multiple nodes, eliminating the need for a central server or platform. This disintermediation significantly reduces the transaction and administrative costs. The blockchain is particularly valuable in applications where reliability and stability are critical because it establishes an open database that ensures data integrity, making it virtually impossible to tamper with or falsify data. This study explores the diverse applications of the blockchain technology in virtual assets, such as cryptocurrency, decentralized finance, central bank digital currency, nonfungible tokens, and metaverses. In addition, it analyzes the potential prospects and developments driven by these innovative technologies. Copyright © The Korea Institute of Information and Communication Engineering.

To empirically assess how CBDC adoption influences regional economic integration, this paper investigates the Greater Bay Area, where China carried out one of its first digital renminbi pilot programs. The Greater Bay Area provides a good example because the growing acceptance of digital renminbi in the area can potentially mitigate transaction costs and risks due to the exchange rate volatility of the Chinese renminbi, Hong Kong dollar, and Macao pataca. CBDC adoption can lead to greater real and financial integrations by facilitating cross-border trade in goods and services. This paper evaluates deviations from uncovered interest rate parity, purchasing power parity, and real interest rate parity across Guangdong, Hong Kong, and Macao based on monthly interest rate and price data from January 2016 to December 2022. The time series have mean values near zero, which validate the parity conditions and indicate high degrees of financial, real, and economic integrations. The Markov regime-switching regression model identifies three regimes: (1) pre-Covid, (2) post-Covid, and (3) post-CBDC. The Covid-19 outbreak brought lower integration and stability, but the launch of the CBDC restored some of the pre-Covid integration and stability. Regimes 1 and 2 are persistent, and transitions from Regime 3 back to Regime 1 are probable. Hence, this study finds evidence that CBDC adoption improves regional economic integration in the short and long run. © 2024 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Central bank digital currency; digital renminbi; economic integration; financial integration; Greater Bay Area","","","","","","","","Athari S.A., Kirikkaleli D., Adebayo T.S., World pandemic uncertainty and German stock market: Evidence from Markov regime-switching and Fourier based approaches, Quality & Quantity, 57, 2, pp. 1923-1936, (2023); (2023); Ayodeji I.O., A three-state Markov-modulated switching model for exchange rates, Journal of Applied Mathematics, 2016, pp. 1-9, (2016); Baharumshah A.Z., Haw C.T., Fountas S., A panel study on real interest rate parity in East Asian countries: Pre- and post-liberalization era, Global Finance Journal, 16, 1, pp. 69-85, (2005); Baharumshah A.Z., Haw C.T., Masih A.M.M., Lau E., Financial integration of East Asian economies: Evidence from real interest parity, Applied Economics, 43, 16, pp. 1979-1990, (2011); Bayoumi T.A., Eichengreen B.J., Shocking aspects of European monetary integration, (1993); Bayoumi T.A., Eichengreen B.J., One money or many?

Our research developed a novel conceptual framework that investigated the relationships between technology, cognitive factors, and behavioral intentions towards CBDC use. The framework integrated UPI usage experience as a moderator within existing models of behavioral intentions and use behaviors. We collected data through a survey conducted in major Indian cities during the pilot launch of CBDC. By utilizing a partial least squares structural equation model (PLS-SEM), we analyzed the proposed model and the relationships between the constructs. Our findings revealed the significant impact of hedonic motivation and performance expectancy on users’ behavioral intentions towards CBDC. Social influence also played a significant role in CBDC usage. Furthermore, we identified that prior UPI usage negatively moderated the relationship between performance expectancy and behavioral intention, as well as the relationship between social influence and use behavior. However, prior UPI usage did not significantly moderate the relationships between perceived risk, hedonic motivation, behavioral intention, and use behavior. These findings contribute to our understanding of the factors influencing CBDC adoption and usage behavior in India. © 2023 by the authors.","behavioral intention; central bank digital currency; hedonic motivation; India; perceived risk; performance expectancy; social influence; unified payments interface; UPI usage experience; use behavior","","","","","","","","Abbasi G.A., Tiew L.Y., Tang J., Goh Y.N., Thurasamy R., The Adoption of Cryptocurrency as a Disruptive Force: Deep Learning–Based Dual Stage Structural Equation Modelling and Artificial Neural Network Analysis, PLoS ONE, 16, (2021); Abdul-Hamid I.K., Shaikh A.A., Boateng H., Hinson R.E., Customers’ Perceived Risk and Trust in Using Mobile Money Services—An Empirical Study of Ghana, International Journal of E–Business Research, 15, pp. 1-19, (2019); Abrahao R.D.S., Moriguchi S.N., Andrade D.F., Factors Influencing the Adoption of Mobile Payment Method among Generation Z: The Extended UTAUT Approach, RAI Revista de Administração e Inovação, 13, pp. 221-230, (2021); Acharya B., ORF_IssueBrief_177, Issue Briefs and Special Reports, (2017); Adrian T., Griffoli T.M., The Rise of Digital Money, FinTech Notes, 19, (2019); Aggarwal K., Malik S., Mishra D.K., Paul D., Moving from Cash to Cashless Economy: Toward Digital India, The Journal of Asian Finance, Economics and Business, 8, pp. 43-54, (2021); Akbar F., What Affects Students’ Acceptance and Use of Technology?, (2013); Alonso S.L.N., Jorge-Vazquez J., ReierForradellas R.F., Central Banks Digital Currency: Detection of Optimal Countries for the Implementation of a CBDC and the Implication for Payment Industry Open Innovation, Journal of Open Innovation: Technology, Market, and Complexity, 7, (2021); Amirtha R., Sivakumar V.J., Hwang Y., Influence of Perceived Risk Dimensions on E–Shopping Behavioural Intention among Women—A Family Life Cycle Stage Perspective, Journal of Theoretical and Applied Electronic Commerce Research, 16, pp. 320-355, (2020); Arias-Oliva M., Pelegrin-Borondo J., Matias-Clavero G., Variables Influencing Cryptocurrency Use: A Technology Acceptance Model in Spain, Frontiers in Psychology, 10, (2019); Asongu S., Amari M., Jarboui A., Mouakhar K., ICT Dynamics for Gender Inclusive Intermediary Education: Minimum Poverty and Inequality Thresholds in Developing Countries, Telecommunications Policy, 45, (2021); Baabdullah A.M., Alalwan A.A., Rana N.P., Kizgin H., Patil P., Consumer Use of Mobile Banking (M–Banking) in Saudi Arabia: Towards an Integrated Model, International Journal of Information Management, 44, pp. 38-52, (2018); Babin R., Smith D., Shah H., Central bank digital currency: Advising the financial services industry, Journal of Information Technology Teaching Cases, (2022); Bakshy E., Rosenn I., Marlow C., Adamic L., The Role of Social Networks in Information Diffusion, WWW’12—Proceedings of the 21st Annual Conference on World Wide Web, pp. 519-528, (2012); Baur A.W., Buhler J., Bick M., Bonorden C.S., Cryptocurrencies as a Disruption?

However, for some, such central bank intervention is observed as nothing more than an unnecessary hindrance and a threat to both confidentiality and potential profitability. Using estimated sentiment indices based on CBDC-related social media posts, and testing for the effects of regulatory-related announcements upon blockchain and cryptocurrency-related funds, this research presents two key findings: first, the continued evolution of the pricing structures of digital finance products to respond to such perceived threats constitutes a further evolutionary point in the product’s life-cycle. However, secondly, the very fact that returns fall while volatility increases indicate a largely negative market response to the threat of potential external regulation of cryptocurrencies in the future. The nature of this negative response validates concerns that anonymity continues to be an attractive central feature for cryptocurrency stakeholders, further verifying the necessity for third-party oversight. © 2023, Oviedo University Press.

This study proposes, from a system feedback loop and cybernetics perspective, a Dynamic Issuance Mechanism (DIM) for CBDC that can theoretically enhance the vitality of economic operations. In accordance with this mechanism, the central bank implements dynamic issuance by monitoring cash leakage in real-time, so as to maintain the stability of the amount of money circulating on the market, thereby boosting the currency turnover rate and financial vitality. To demonstrate the efficacy of the DIM, we employ the Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) tool to develop a macroeconomic simulation model for qualitative analysis that includes four entities: Central Bank, households, firms, and commercial banks. The multi-cycle operation process of the model includes a variety of economic indicators demonstrating that DIM has the potential to boost economic vitality and social production efficiency without exerting an adverse effect on citizens' incomes, commodity prices, or the stability of the macroeconomic system. Finally, the function principle and potential risks of DIM are explained from a systems perspective, which offers a novel perspective for the functional design of CBDC and highlights that the hierarchical structure is a meaningful domain as the developmental direction.  © 2023 - IOS Press.

This paper introduces central bank digital currency into traditional accounts receivable financing and solves the credit risk and information asymmetry risk using two technologies of central bank digital currency: digital technology and blockchain technology; digital technology enables the supervision of capital flow, and blockchain technology enables for access to logistics and information flow. In the context of using central bank digital currency technology, this paper builds an evolutionary game model of whether financial institutions use central bank digital currency and whether SMEs repay the loan, compares the evolutionary stabilization strategies of financial institutions and SMEs, calculates and analyzes the model’s impact, investigates changes in the decision-making and evolutionary paths of both parties, and then conducts numerical simulation analysis using Matlab and Python to verify the model’s reliability further. According to the results, adding central bank digital currency to the traditional accounts receivable financing model can reduce the loan risk of financial institutions, increase the credibility of accounts receivable financing, expedite the implementation of accounts receivable financing, and alleviate the financing concerns of SMEs. © 2023 by the authors.","accounts receivable financing; central bank digital currency; supply chain finance","","","","","","","","Akram U., Fulop M.T., Tiron-Tudor A., Topor D.I., Capusneanu S., Impact of Digitalization on Customers’ Well-Being in the Pandemic Period: Challenges and Opportunities for the Retail Industry, Int.

We construct a dual currency model to study whether CBDC with a record-keeping technology can reduce tax evasion incentives in cash transactions and further achieve better allocations than a cash-only economy with respect to fiscal arithmetic. We show that when there is inefficiency associated with tax evasion in cash transactions, introducing CBDC with strictly positive interest can remove the inefficiency and thus improve welfare by discouraging tax evasion and rewarding tax payments. This beneficial effect of the CBDC depends on the central bank's fiscal role. © 2022 Western Economic Association International.","cash; central bank digital currency; inflation tax; monetary policy; tax evasion","","","","","","Bank of Canada, BOC; Sveriges Riksbanken; Ministry of Education, MOE; National Research Foundation of Korea, NRF, (NRF‐2020S1A5A8044740)","Funding text 1: We are grateful to Yongsung Chang, Jonathan Chiu, Joonmo Cho, Mohammad Davoodalhosseini, Todd Keister, Byoung-ki Kim, Jinill Kim, Sunghyun Kim, Young-Sik Kim, Dong Won Lee, Fransisco Rivadeneyra, Byung Khun Song, Sang-yoon Song, Jungu Yang, and Yu Zhu for their useful comments and suggestions.

The paper argues that this will require central banks to emphasise the risk-free nature of central bank digital currency. In addition, payment transactions need to be made less expensive and more user-friendly than those offered by private intermediaries. The paper explains the benefits of adopting a digital currency instead of relying on cash alone, such as the ability to send and receive payments remotely, improved security, and greater transparency vis-à-vis historical transactions. After discussing the key design features that a digital euro might adopt, the paper concludes that an account-based digital euro could have a greater impact on financial inclusion than a token-based euro.The more that digital euro accounts are integrated into existing payment systems, the greater the benefits will be. © Henry Stewart Publications,.","central bank digital currency; digital euro; electronic money; financial inclusion; payment innovation; payment instrument","","","","","","","","Report on a Digital Euro, (2020); Demirguc-Kunt A., Klapper L., Singer D., Ansar S., Hess J., The Global Findex Database 2017: Measuring Financial Inclusion and the Fintech Revolution, (2018); Federico D., Grazioli R., Milioli M.A., Notte A., Poletti L., Financial and social inclusion in Europe, European Investment Fund Working Paper 2021/72, (2021); Nuzzo G., Piermattei S., Measuring financial inclusion in the main euro area countries: the role of electronic cards, Questioni di Economia e Finanza (Occasional Papers), (2019); Tissot B., Gadanecz B., Measures of financial inclusion — a central bank perspective, The role of data in supporting financial inclusion policy, 47, (2018); Fondeville N., Ozdemir E., Ward T., Financial Exclusion in the EU.

Using Hofstede’s cultural framework (i.e. Power Distance, Individualism, Masculinity, Uncertainty Avoidance and Long-term Orientation) to measure different cultural values, we find that countries with more power distance, masculinity and long-term orientation cultures are more eager to adopt a CBDC. By contrast, countries with a cultural value leaning towards uncertainty avoidance are less involved in the adoption of a CBDC. These results hold more for retail CBDC than for wholesale CBDC. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","central bank digital currency; National culture; retail CBDC; wholesale CBDC","central bank; culture; currency; retailing","","","","","","","Auer R., Frost J., Gambacorta L., Monnet C., Rice T., Shin H.S., Central Bank Digital Currencies: Motives, Economic Implications and the Research Frontier, BIS Working Paper no. 976, (2021); Bindseil U., Central Bank Digital Currency: Financial System Implications and Control, International Journal of Political Economy, 48, 4, pp. 303-335, (2019); Bordo M.D., Levin A.T., Central Bank Digital Currency and the Future of Monetary Policy, NBER Working Paper No. 23711, (2017); Boubakri N., Chkir I., Saadi S., Zhu H., Does National Culture Affect Corporate Innovation?

To this end, this study designs a CBDC system based on the prototype of digital currency electronic payment (DCEP) that can provide real-time transaction verification, with an emphasis on comprehensive supervision, privacy-preserving transactions, verifiable audits, and a constant amount of CBDC. Meanwhile, we use blockchain technology and Pederson Commitment to design architecture to prove the records' veracity and the auditing's accuracy. The results of numerical experiments show that under the proposed CBDC system, (1) the central bank can audit 50 commercial banks in roughly one second; (2) the true value of the total bonds is comparable to the amount calculated by the Pedersen Committee; (3) the operation performance of the system is superior. Therefore, the security, effectiveness and practicability of our proposed CBDC system are demonstrated. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Blockchain; CBDC; DCEP; Pederson commitment; Supervise","","","","","","Hunan Social Science Achievement Review Committee, (XSP21YBC087); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (71850012, 72104075, 72192800, 72274056); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Hunan Provincial Science and Technology Department, HSTD, (2018GK1020); Hunan Provincial Science and Technology Department, HSTD; Hunan University, HNU; Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province, (2022JJ40106); Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province; National Office for Philosophy and Social Sciences, NPOPSS, (19AZD014, ZD125); National Office for Philosophy and Social Sciences, NPOPSS","This research is also supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 71850012 , 72104075 , 72192800 , 72274056 ), the National Social Science Fund of China (No. 19AZD014 , 21&ZD125 ), the Major Special Projects of the Department of Science and Technology of Hunan province (No. 2018GK1020 ), the Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province (No. 2022JJ40106 ), the Hunan Social Science Achievement Review Committee (No. XSP21YBC087 ), and Hunan University Youth Talent Program .","Abbassi W., Kumari V., Pandey D.K., What makes firms vulnerable to the Russia-Ukraine crisis?, J.

A CBDC has certain potential benefits, including the possibility that it can bear interest. However, using a CBDC is costly for agents. I study the optimal monetary policy when only cash, only a CBDC, or both cash and a CBDC are available to agents. If the cost of using a CBDC is not too high, more efficient allocations can be implemented by using a CBDC than using cash, and the first best can be achieved. Having both cash and a CBDC available may result in lower welfare than in the cases where only cash or only a CBDC is available. The welfare gains of introducing a CBDC are estimated under various scenarios for the United States and Canada. For example, if the cost of using a CBDC relative to cash is around 0.25% of the transaction value, introducing a CBDC can lead to an increase of 0.12–0.21% consumption for the United States and 0.04–0.07% for Canada. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Cash; Central bank digital currency; Monetary policy;","","","","","","","","Agarwal R., Kimball M., (2015); Agur I., Ari A., Dell'Ariccia G., (2019); Andolfatto D., Essential interest-bearing money, J.

Retail CBDC is more advanced in countries with lower financial inclusion and a large informal economy. We further show that different factors affect retail CBDC adoption across emerging and advanced countries. However, cross-border transactions are the most crucial factor influencing wholesale CBDC adoption across emerging and advanced countries. © 2022 EJPAM All rights reserved.","Central bank digital currency; Financial development; Financial inclusion; Technology adoption","","","","","","","","An J., Hou W., Lin C., Epidemic Disease and Financial Development, Journal of Financial Economics, 143, pp. 332-358, (2022); Agur I., Ari A., Dell'Ariccia G., Designing Central Bank Digital Currencies, Journal of Monetary Economics, (2021); Alfonso V., Boar C., Frost J., Gambacorta L., Liu J., E-commerce in the Pandemic and Beyond, BIS Bulletin, 36, (2021); Allen F., Gu X., Jagtiani J., Fintech, Cryptocurrencies, and CBDC: Financial Structural Transformation in China, Journal of International Money and Finance, 124, (2022); Auer R., Cornelli G., Frost J., Rise of the Central Bank Digital Currencies: Drivers, Approaches and Technologies, (2020); Auer R., Cornelli G., Frost J., COVID-19, Cash, and the Future of Payments, BIS Bulletin, 3, pp. 1-7, (2020); Auer R., Monnet C., Shin H.

They have accumulated significant capital buffers. Those buffers should be further more augmented by 2027 in line with Basel III reforms. However, disregarding such a consecutive rise in the banking capital adequacy requirements, the US financial authorities undertook an unprecedented step. First time in the country history they lowered the reserve requirement to zero at the end of March 2020. Friedrich von Hayek demonstrated the fragility of the modern fractional reserve banking systems. Together with Ludwig von Mises (von Mises, 1978) he was thus able to predict the Great Depression of 1929 and explain its mechanics much in advance. Thus, we wish to utilize the agent-based modeling technique to extend von Hayek's rationale to the previously unstudied interaction of capital adequacy and reserve requirement regulation. We find that the full reserve requirement regime even without capital adequacy regulation provides more stable financial environment than the existing one. Rise in capital adequacy adds to modern banking sustainability, but it still preserves the system remarkably fragile compared to the full reserve requirement. We also prove that capital adequacy regulation is redundant when the latter environment is in place. We discuss our findings application to the potential Central Bank Digital Currencies regulation.  © 2021-IOS Press.

Currently, some 100 central banks are researching and investigating the concept of a central bank digital currency (CBDC) and its implementation options.1 Over half of these central banks have reached the development stage, and some are already conducting on-site experiments. However, the intense interest and the efforts made have not yet led to an increasing number of implementations, since so far only the Bahamas (Sand Dollar), the Member Countries of the Eastern Caribbean Currency Union (DCash) and Nigeria (eNaira) have introduced a CBDC. The other countries are currently still in one of the preparatory stages. The article briefly reviews the history of money digitalisation, and describes the various motives for issuing a CBDC, as well as the variety of challenges faced in the process of introducing a CBDC. It also presents the preparations taken so far for the introduction of the digital Euro, as well as Sweden’s e-krona. Finally, it summarises the authors’ views on the strategy Hungary should follow regarding a CBDC. © 2022 The authors.","CBDC; central bank digital currency; digital euro","","","","","","","","Banai A., Nagy B.,  Century, a Book of Studies on Digital Central Bank Money by the Magyar Nemzeti Bank], (2021); Bartha L., Digitális pénzek [Digital Money], konferencia előadás [conference presentation], (2017); Deak V., Kajdi L., Nemecsko I., Vegso T., Az idő pénz – Fizetési módok társadalmi költségének felmérése [Time is money - Assessing the Social Cost of Payment Methods], Hitelintézeti Szemle, 2, pp. 5-36, (2022); Faykiss P., Horvath B.I., Horvath G., Kiss-Mihaly N., Nyikes A., Szombati A., A pénz átalakulása a digitális korban [The Transformation of Money in the Digital Age], Polgári Szemle, pp. 4-6, (2021); Murphy H., Stacey K., Facebook Libra: the inside story of how the company’s cryptocurrency dream died, (2022); Panetta F., Adapting to the fast-moving cyber threat landscape – Introductory remarks at the seventh meeting of the Euro Cyber Resilience Board for pan-European Financial Infrastructures, (2022); Szabo G., Kollarik A., Az MNB elmagyarázza, mi is az a digitális jegybankpénz [MNB Explains what Digital Central Bank Money is], (2017); Zhuang J., Facilitating Cross-Border Payments, (2022); Covid-19 accelerated the digitalisation of payments, (2021); Innovations in retail payments, (2012); mBridge – Building a multi CBDC platform for international payments, (2021); BIS IH, Project Dunbar: International settlements using multi-CBDCs, (2021); (2022); Contribution to the ongoing debate on a Central Bank Digital Euro #3: How does a digital euro fit the payments landscape?, (2021); Position Paper Central Bank Digital Euro – strategic issues – final clean; Consumer Expectations Survey: an overview and first evaluation, (2021); Eurosystem report on the public consultation on a digital euro, (2021); Targeted consultation on a digital euro, (2022); Regulation, Supervision and Oversight of “Global Stablecoin” Arrangements, (2020); Assessment of Risks to Financial Stability from Crypto-assets, (2022); E-krona report – E-krona pilot Phase 2, (2022); Considerations on offline Central Bank Digital Currency payments – White paper, (2021); Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index, (2022); Defining Interoperability, (2021); Remittance Prices Worldwide, Remittance Prices Worldwide – Issue 38, (2021)","","","State Audit Office of Hungary","","","","","","0031496X","","","","English","Publ.

After the global financial crisis of 2008-2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020, along with the introduction of all-new cryptocurrencies and stable coins, even many central banks have voiced an interest in the introduction of digital currencies. Hence, the pros and cons of the new central bank digital currencies (CBDC) are the newest widely discussed topic. This paper focuses on the ways a new instrument, central bank digital currency (CBDC),is expected to improve the modern payment systems, increase the efficacy of monetary policy and ensure financial stability in the new era. The study concludes that although CBDCs might boost monetary policy effectiveness and financial stability, it is vital to reevaluate and thoroughly analyse the geopolitical, geoeconomic, and geostrategic implications and effects of having a CBDC. © 2022, SETA Foundation.

In a DSGE model calibrated to match the pre-2008 US, we find that CBDC issuance of 30% of GDP, against government bonds, could permanently raise GDP by 3%, due to lower real interest rates, distortionary taxes, and monetary transaction costs. Countercyclical CBDC policy rules, as a second monetary policy tool, could substantially improve the central bank's ability to stabilise the business cycle.

Our findings suggest that CBDC may not be widely accepted by end users in the presence of a sizable informal economy in which cash is the primary method of payment. CBDC can decrease informality, but this effect becomes weaker in countries with larger informal economies.

To facilitate a smooth money transfer process, the interactive experience of the CBDC user interface design is very important. However, much of the current research has focused on the technical feasibility of the CBDCs, and no scientific research has yet attempted to design an effective CBDC user interface. In this study, a series of CBDC user interfaces were designed to help study the interaction process of CBDCs in a simulated payment transaction context with a focus on the user interface and interactive experience of the CBDCs. The experiment in this study was a 2 (graphical metaphor) × 3 (gesture type) × 2 (visual feedback) mixed factorial design in which a total of 12 CBDC prototypes were created and evaluated based on users’ task performance and a series of subjective evaluations. The results of our empirical study revealed that graphical metaphor user interface design can improve the interface usability and subjective evaluation of CBDCs, and may also trigger the user’s sense of experience with traditional banknotes. Specifically, the use of animated cues for currency movement on the CBDC user interface may help evoke the user’s experience of using cash. In addition, we found that the wave type gesture may cause users to spend more time completing the CBDC operational tasks. Moreover, the animated cue of money moving may have faster performance and a higher degree of rationality. The above-mentioned results may provide an important design reference for CBDC developers to create easy-to-use CBDC services. © 2023 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Central Bank Digital Currencies; gesture type;

This paper presents a discussion of Agur et al. (2021), in which the authors study the optimal design of a central bank digital currency (CDBC). The main result of the work is that an interest-bearing CBDC (in particular, negative remuneration) alleviates the tradeoff between bank intermediation and the social value of maintaining cash. To be fully convincing from a policymaker's point of view, the results should be tested along several dimensions, including considering a wider range of trade offs with regards to the introduction of a CBDC. © 2021","CBDC; Digital currency; Financial intermediation; Fintech; Network effects","","","","","","","","Andolfatto D., Assessing the impact of central bank digital currency on private banks, Econ.

The study was carried out by using the hypothetical-deductive method with a basic descriptive approach rather than an experimental one. To estimate the probability of creating the Digital Currency of the Central Bank and the economic variables that explain its challenges and cross-sectional information obtained from the 2020 National Household Survey with the discrete choice model (Logit). According to the research results, i) the possibility of using a digital currency increases by 46.83% if you have a formal job compared to an informal job. ii) If the individual has an internet connection, the probability of using digital currency is 8.54%. iii) If he lives in a rural area, the probability of using digital currency is 1.79. iv) The educational level influences the probability of the use of digital currency by 1.47% if they have secondary education 16.34% have no higher education and 26.44% having university education. v) Individual’s age is important for the use of a digital currency. Older people are less likely to adapt to technology than people between the age of 18 and 24 with 8.74% use of digital currency. vi) People considered poor will have a probability of reduction of 2.26% by the use of digital currency. These findings allow the researcher to conclude that public policies should be undertaken to increase financial inclusion, close connectivity gaps and create alliances with private investment to enhance people's digital skills and the adoption of digital means of payment. © 2022 by the authors; licensee Online Academic Press, USA.","Central bank digital currency; Digital currency; Digital payments; Pilot plan; Retail transactions","","","","","","","","Arauz A., Garratt R., Dinero Electrónico: The rise and fall of Ecuador's central bank digital currency, Latin American Journal of Central Banking, 2, 2, (2021); Armelius H., Boel P., Claussen C.

Prices react asymmetrically to the speeches, increasing more strongly after speeches that take a more positive stance. Similarly, while volatility generally increases, negative CBDC sentiment has a slight amplifying effect. The results indicate that traders do not view CBDCs as a threat to cryptocurrencies. Rather, more positive stances on CBDCs appear to be interpreted as favorable signals for other forms of digital currencies as well. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.","Bitcoin; CBDC; Central bank communication; Central bank digital currencies; Cryptocurrency; Currency competition","","","","","","","","Ante L., How Elon Musk's Twitter activity moves cryptocurrency markets, Working Paper, (2022); Auer R., Claessens S., Regulating cryptocurrencies: assessing market reactions, BIS Q.

The research provides for the development of proposals to improve legal regulation of social relations within the monetary system of the Russian Federation. As this study shows, the national model of digitalisation of the monetary system in Russia has specifics, and the implementation of this project will require further elaboration of its concept in order to identify possible risks and eliminate the shortcomings of the developed model.

Notable achievements include the development of robust digital infrastructure, the emergence of innovative digital finance, and the rapid growth of central bank digital currency.

To a large extent, this depends on the willingness of economic agents to use virtual currencies. The purpose of the study is to explore the factors determining the attitude of economic agents to digital currencies and the impact of financial literacy on using these instruments as an investment object and means of payment. The authors use the following research methods: content analysis, retrospective analysis, methods of comparative cross-country analysis, and empirical research in the form of an online survey of graduate financial students. This study is one of the first to reveal differences in the assessment of their knowledge and readiness to use digital currencies of financial and non-financial students, as well as to confirm an adequate assessment of the risks and opportunities of different types of virtual currencies if students have financial knowledge. The research shows that the situation with the decision-making of economic agents on the use of cryptocurrencies and the CBDC differs: in the first case, the initiative comes from the economic agents themselves, who make decisions at their own peril and risk; in the second case, economic agents are confronted with the fact of the existence of the CBDC and the need to use them. The authors conclude that the population’s low financial and digital literacy can create a mental barrier to the use of CBDC, complicating their implementation in national monetary systems. The lack of financial literacy leads to an exaggeration of their knowledge by participants in the cryptocurrency market. © 2022 Finance: Theory and Practice.

Our sample covers 2853 listed companies in the United States from 2014 to 2018. First, we find the variation of central bank digital currency has a positive impact on a firm's implied volatility. Second, the healthier firms’ conditions can reduce the relationship between central bank digital currency variation and a firm's implied volatility. Third, the positive relation between central bank digital currency and firm's implied volatility still exists in investment-grade, speculative-grade, and unrated firms.

We show that both indices spiked during news related to new developments in CBDC and in relation to digital currency news items. We demonstrate that CBDC indices have a significant negative relationship with the volatilities of the MSCI World Banks Index, USEPU, and the FTSE All-World Index, and positive with the volatilities of cryptocurrency markets, foreign exchange markets, bond markets, VIX, and gold. Our results suggest that financial markets are more sensitive to CBDC Uncertainty than CBDC Attention as proxy by these indices. These findings contain useful insights to individual and institutional investors, and can guide policymakers, regulators, and the media on how CBDC evolved as a barometer in the new digital-currency era. © 2022 The Authors","CBDC; DCC-GJR-GARCH; Market effect; SVAR; Uncertainty and attention index","Financial markets; Central bank; Central bank digital currency; DCC-GJR-GARCH; Institutional investors; Lexisnexis; Market effect; SVAR; Uncertainty; Uncertainty and attention index; World bank; central bank; currency; financial market; uncertainty analysis; vector autoregression; Investments","","","","","Trinity College, University of Oxford; China Scholarship Council, CSC","Funding text 1: The authors would like to acknowledge the support of The China Scholarship Council (project code:202008300011). ; Funding text 2: Yizhi Wang is an adjunct assistant professor and a Ph.D. researcher in Trinity Business School, Trinity College Dublin.

It finds that, based upon prevailing ECB policies and the myriad options available for CBDC design, such claims are flawed. The article further explains that the ECB’s reticence to consider the introduction of CBDC may impair the development of payments systems and obstruct financial inclusion. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.","CBDC; Central bank digital currency; Constitution; EU; Financial stability; Market neutrality","","","","","","","","Abidimiquel-Flores N.I., Who benefits from the corporate QE?

Analysis findings show that permissioned blockchain is more suitable for CBDC than permissionless blockchain.

Meanwhile, the response intensity reduces over time, thereby reflecting the weakening sensibility of the fintech sector to the CBDC signals.

Unknown are, however, the primary factors of public support for the initiative and CBDC acceptance choices. Moreover, despite the fact that CBDC's success requires substantial public support, there is less empirical data of how the public perceives and speaks about it. This research seeks to fill in these gaps using Facebook data from May 2012 to April 2022 using deep learning algorithms for text mining. This research demonstrates that government performance, inflation rate, economic inequality, and technological literacy have a significant influence on the public's perception of CBDC. The government's support of CBDC is determined by public sentiment, the degree of adoption of decentralized finance (Defi), and monetary policy settings. The degree of wealth inequality and technological literacy are two other demographic elements that influence the government's adoption of CBDC. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Central bank digital currency; Financial market conditions; Governmental factors; Monetary policy; Public sentiment; Text mining","","","","","","Đại học Kinh tế Thành phố Hồ Chí Minh","This research is funded by University of Economics Ho Chi Minh City , Vietnam (UEH).

This paper discusses two different types of digital currencies, including: central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) and privately issued cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. The findings of this study suggest that current accounting standards do not precisely cover the accounting treatment of digital currencies, even though the estimated value of market capitalisation of cryptocurrency in 2022 was USD 200 billion. This conceptual paper identifies the imminent need for an accounting standard to provide guidance on the identification, classification, measurement, and presentation of digital currencies. In the interim, existing accounting standards can be amended to incorporate digital currencies to avoid inconsistent global accounting approaches. © 2023 The Authors","Accounting; Blockchain; Central bank digital currency; Cryptocurrencies; Decentralised technology; Digital currency; Triple-entry accounting","","","","","","","","Bech M., Garratt R., Central bank cryptocurrencies, BIS Q.

A quantitative survey with 1034 respondents was analyzed using partial least squares structural equation model (PLS-SEM). Empirical results indicate that multiple antecedents are associated with privacy concerns in the digital euro that in turn influence intention to adopt a digital euro. Especially soft trust factors such as credibility and image are found to influence both privacy concerns and the intention to adopt a digital euro. It contributes to the current literature by introducing trust as a second-order construct composed of hard and soft trust factors for digital currencies. The results provide valuable insights for researchers and practitioners aiming at designing and implementing CBDCs by demonstrating which factors need to be considered in order to achieve widespread adoption by citizens. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","CBDC; Central bank digital currency; Digital Euro; Electronic payment systems; Privacy concerns; Trust","Electronic money; Surveys; Central bank; Central bank digital currency; Digital euro; Electronic payment systems; Privacy concerns; Trust; Trust factor; Work analysis; Least squares approximations","","","","","","","Ajzen I., The theory of planned behavior, Organ.

Yet, since a central bank is not an investment expert, it cannot invest in long-term projects itself, but relies on investment banks to do so. We derive an equivalence result that shows that absent a banking panic, the set of allocations achieved with private financial intermediation will also be achieved with a CBDC. During a panic, however, we show that the rigidity of the central bank's contract with the investment banks has the capacity to deter runs. Thus, the central bank is more stable than the commercial banking sector. Consumers internalize this feature ex-ante, and the central bank arises as a deposit monopolist, attracting all deposits away from the commercial banking sector. This monopoly might endanger maturity transformation. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Bank runs; Central bank digital currency; Central banking; Intermediation; Lender of last resort; Maturity transformation","","","","","","Simons Institute at UC Berkeley","The contribution of Linda Schilling has been prepared under the Lamfalussy fellowship program sponsored by the ECB.

However, there are as many points urging caution. In this context, the purpose of the present paper is to analyse the specificity of the potential digital euro as part of the international payments’ architecture. The European Central Bank (ECB) is focusing on the digital euro project, running the investigation phase until October 2023. The debate on the digital euro adoption is in line with the international one, but there are several distinctive aspects. Various scenarios are taken into account, starting from general principles for retail CBDCs, results of the public consultation of a digital euro, experts’ opinions regarding privacy, security, usability, costs, offline use, acceptance, potential disintermediation, standards and international implications of the digital euro. The research also outlines the relations between major actors involved, while identifying the prerequisites for a swift functioning of the Eurozone payment system with digital euro at its core. © 2022","central bank digital currency; Digital currencies; digital euro","","","","","","","","Adrian T., BigTech in Financial Services, (2021); Adrian T., Mancini-Griffoli T., The Rise of Digital Money, (2019); Allen S., Et al., Design choices for Central Bank Digital Currency Policy and technical considerations, (2020); Arauz A., Garratt R., Ramos D.

By adapting the theoretical framework of Dutkowsky and VanHoose (2018b, 2020) to the euro area, this study investigates and clarifies the conditions under which a digital euro could be introduced on a large scale without leading to bank disintermediation or a credit crunch. First, the central bank would require proper mechanisms to manage the volume and the user cost of CBDC in circulation. Second, the central bank should continue to facilitate access to its long-term lending facilities, to provide banks with a funding source alternative to client deposits at an equivalent cost. Depending on its design, a digital euro could improve bank profitability and competitiveness by absorbing large amounts of idle (and expensive) excess reserves without penalizing lending, while incentivizing bank digitalization. © 2022","Bank lending; Cash, Monetary policy; Central bank digital currency; Digital euro; Excess reserves","","","","","","","","Aberg P., Corsi M., Grossmann-Wirth V., Hudepohl T., Mudde Y., Rosolin T., Schobert F., (2021); Agur I., Ari A., Dell'Ariccia G., (2019); Altavilla C., Burlon L., Giannetti M., Holton S., (2019); Altavilla C., Lemke W., Linzert T., Tapking J., (2021); Andreeva D.C., Garcia-Posada M., The impact of the ECB's targeted long-term refinancing operations on banks’ lending policies: the role of competition, J.

This notion goes beyond the conceptualisation of the traditional Westphalian sovereignty of interference-free discretion, which is necessary because of the hierarchical operational complexity of the fiat and credit money systems in the modern financial system. At the same time, the monetary challenges of the 21st century may also erode the effective monetary sovereignty of states, which can, however, be partially rescued through the introduction of digital central bank money. The paper therefore explores different areas of the impact of digital central bank money on effective monetary sovereignty, taking chartalist monetary theory as a starting point.

According to studies, India's financial system plays a significant role in the execution of the CBDC. India is at the forefront of technological advancements in digital payment methods. The central banks that support CBDC's design concept are susceptible to adaptations to the evolution of economic and financial systems. This study will highlight the potential of CBDC to boost financial inclusion. Quantitative regression analysis is being used to quantify the potential drivers of financial sector efficiency and stability to measure the impact of CBDC implementation on financial inclusion. The central bank should build the CBDC utilizing the Structural Vector Auto-Regression model while considering payment system visibility. The proposed study can help to identify the lags in attaining financial inclusion in India and to design CBDC. The proposed study can also establish the policymakers' role in maximizing benefits to the consumers. The study establishes the potential role of RBI in the smooth functionality of implementing CBDC. The study brings out the trend of the payment system in India that opens up the possibility of positive implementation of CBDC and its welfare to percolate among consumers. © 2023, University of Wollongong.

This paper examines the role of a central bank digital currency in the circular economy. Central banks can contribute to the transition to a circular economy in two ways: first, by making central bank digital currency accessible to circular businesses and other players in the circular economy sector, and second, by looking into how the design features of CBDC can support circular economy goals. On the role of CBDC in the circular economy, I argue that a central bank digital currency offers a better payment option for circular economy financial transactions; central bank digital currency can lead to greater financial inclusion for ‘unbanked’ informal workers in the circular economy; CBDC can create a gateway that allows a central bank to offer financial assistance to distressed circular businesses; using a central bank digital currency can reduce illicit activities in the circular economy; a central bank digital currency can be used to provide stimulus funding to support circular businesses during crises; and, a central bank digital currency can offer low transaction cost for circular economy financial transactions. The paper also shows the link between CBDC and the circular economy. It also offers a critical perspective on the link between CBDC and the circular economy. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Blockchain; CBDC design; Central bank; Central bank digital currency; Circular economy; Circular finance; Innovation; Linear economy; Payment system; Resources; Sustainability; Sustainable development","","","","","","","","Blomsma F., Tennant M., Circular economy: preserving materials or products?

It can be argued that digital payment is helpful in supply chain management applications. However, the adoption of CBDC in the supply chain could bring new turbulence since the CBDC value may fluctuate. Therefore, this paper intends to optimize the production plan of manufacturing supply chain based on a volatility clustering model by reducing CBDC value uncertainty. We apply both GARCH model and machine learning model to depict the CBDC volatility clustering. Empirically, we employed Baltic Dry Index, Bitcoin and exchange rate as main variables with sample period from 2015 to 2021 to evaluate the performance of the two models. On this basis, we reveal that our machine learning model overwhelmingly outperforms the GARCH model. Consequently, our result implies that manufacturing companies’ performance can be strengthened through CBDC uncertainty reduction. © 2022 The Authors","CBDC; Digital currency; Machine learning; Supply chain management; Volatility clustering","","","","","","Academy of Longyuan, (LYZDB2004); International Research Center for Sustainable Finance","This paper is supported by the Academy of Longyuan Construction Financial Research Grant (Grant Number: LYZDB2004 ) and is also supported by International Research Center for Sustainable Finance .

This paper discusses the ECB’s report, before examining other global CBDC initiatives and then proposing a possible blueprint for a digital euro. The paper argues that if the key parties continue to combine their expertise, Europe will not only have a world-class blueprint for a digital euro, but also a template for the creation of a future digital world currency based on European design principles. © Henry Stewart Publications, 1750-1806.","CBDC; Central bank digital currency; Digital currency; Digital euro; Electronic identity; Euro area","","","","","","","","Report on a Digital Euro, (2020); Statistical Data Warehouse, (2021); Study on the Payment Attitudes of Consumers in the Euro Area (SPACE), (2020); Esselink H., Hernandez L., The Use of Cash by Households in the Euro Area, (2017); Coeure B., Towards the retail payments of tomorrow: a European strategy, (2019); Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions on a Retail Payments Strategy for the EU; European Central Bank; Panetta F., Conclusion of the ECB public consultation on a digital euro, (2021); European Central Bank; Report of the Euro Legal Tender Expert Group (ELTEG) on the definition, scope and effects of legal tender of euro banknotes and coins, (2010); Bossu W., Itatani M., Margulis C, Rossi A.

Motivated by the financial crisis and prospect of a cashless society, countries are researching CBDC. Recently, global consideration has been given to paying basic income to avoid consumer sentiment shrinkage and recession due to epidemics. CBDC is coming into the spotlight as the way to manage the public finance policy of nations comprehensively. CBDC is studied by many countries. The bank of the Bahamas released Sand Dollar. Each country’s central bank should consider the situation in which CBDCs are exchanged. The transaction of the CDDB is open data. Transaction registers CBDC exchange information of the central bank in the blockchain. Open data on currency exchange between countries will provide information on the flow of money between countries. This paper proposes a blockchain system and management method based on the ISO/IEC 11179 metadata registry for exchange between CBDCs that records transactions between registered CBDCs. Each country’s CBDC will have a different implementation and time of publication. We implement the blockchain system and experiment with the operation method, measuring the block generation time of blockchains using the proposed method. © 2021 by the authors.

The writings of Robert Eisler represent an early attempt to design an economic system to permanently stabilise the price level, to solve unemployment and prevent economic crises. Against the backdrop of the Great Depression of the 1920s, Eisler proposed an extensive reform package including public work programmes financed by debt monetisation, the introduction of a parallel currency to level out price level fluctuations as well as instruments for exchange rate stabilisation. Eisler’s work demonstrates the seminal insights that national economies are embedded in a global financial system and that any attempts to reform financial systems require international cooperation in order to be effective. Notwithstanding, Eisler is largely ignored both by monetary reformers and conservative economists, who, if at all aware of his work, declared him a ‘monetary heretic’. This paper analyses Eisler’s entire set of reform ideas for the first time and positions it within current economic policy discourses on the limits to monetary policies, on effective demand and public work programmes and the need to consider international capital when drafting monetary reform proposals. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","central bank digital currency; international capital flows; MMT; public work programmes; Zero lower bound","","","","","","","","Aboobaker A., Ugurlu E., (2020); Adam K., Tzamourani P., Distributional Consequences of Asset Price Inflation in the Euro Area, European Economic Review, 89, C, pp. 172-192, (2016); Agarwal R., Krogstrup S., (2019); Akyuz Y., The Financial Crisis and the Global South: A Development Perspective, (2013); Andrade R., Prates D., Exchange Rate Dynamics in a Peripheral Monetary Economy, Journal of Post Keynesian Economics, 35, 3, pp. 399-416, (2013); (1998); Assenmacher K., Krogstrup S., (2018); Batten S., Sowerbutts R., Tanaka M., Climate Change: Macroeconomic Impact and Implications for Monetary Policy, Ecological, Societal, and Technological Risks and the Financial Sector, (2020); Bonizzi B., An Alternative Post-Keynesian Framework for Understanding Capital Flows to Emerging Markets, Journal of Economic Issues, 51, 1, pp. 137-162, (2017); Bonizzi B., Michell J., Kaltenbrunner A., (2019); Bortz P.G., Kaltenbrunner A., The International Dimension of Financialization in Developing and Emerging Economies, Development and Change, 49, 2, pp. 375-393, (2018); Buiter W., Overcoming the Zero Bound on Nominal Interest Rates: Gesell’s Currency Carry Tax vs. Eisler’s Parallel Virtual Currency, International Economics and Economic Policy, 2, pp. 189-200, (2005); Buiter W., Negative Nominal Interest Rates: Three Ways to Overcome the Zero Lower Bound, The North American Journal of Economics and Finance, 20, 3, pp. 213-238, (2009); Chick V., Macroeconomics After Keynes, (1983); Cowles A., The Meetings of the Econometric Society in Philadelphia and Boston, December 1933, Econometrica, 2, 2, pp. 204-220, (1934); Cummings A.C., (1932); Dimand R., Cranks, Heretics and Macroeconomics in the 1930s, History of Economic Review, 16, 1, pp. 11-30, (1991); Eichengreen B., Bretton Woods After 50, Review of Political Economy, 33, 4, pp. 552-569, (2021); Einaudi L., Faucci R., Marchionatti R., The Theory of Imaginary Money from Charlemagne to the French Revolution, Luigi Einaudi: Selected Economic Essays, (2006); Einstein A., (1926); Eisler R., Studien zur Werttheorie, (1902); Eisler R., Das Geld, seine geschichtliche Entstehung und gesellschaftliche Bedeutung ein wirtschaftswissenschaftlicher Lichtbild-Lehrgang, (1924); Eisler R., This Money Maze, (1931); Eisler R., Stable Money: The Remedy for the Economic World Crisis, (1932); Eisler R., Internal Price Stability Versus Exchange Stability: A Note on Professor J.

Crisis phenomena act as a special incentive to change. This is the case of the financial crises of 2007+ and 2020+ (the Covid crisis). Observation of the central banks’ evolution – also in reaction to the crisis phenomena – leads to the conclusion that central banks are currently responsible not only for implementing monetary policies but also – increasingly – for providing support to economic policies. The aim of this article is to define the modern role of central banks, taking into consideration the acceleration of global changes in the field of digitalisation and climate policy. Special attention is paid to currency digitalisation, in particular to the consequences of central bank currency digitalisation. The paper also verifies the hypotheses of the far-reaching consequences for the model of banking system operation, following from the implementation of central bank digital currency. Moreover, the article verifies the hypothesis of the growing role of central banks in shaping economic (climate) policy. The potential impact of currency digitalisation and central banks’ engagement in climate policy on their position and autonomy is also analysed. The intention of this article is to promote the author’s observations on the challenges that central banks are facing at the time of current transformations. This paper also opens up an opportunity for future, in-depth studies and analyses (especially in the case of widespread implementation of the trends described herein). In the article, the author relies on the method of critical analysis of the literature and available sources, descriptive and comparative studies and a case study. The author’s analysis of EU central banks’ websites has shown that seven banks do not publish documents/reports or information about central bank digital currency, while only three of them do not publish documents, reports, studies or press releases referring to the issues of climate protection or climate policy or the so called green financing/investment projects. It should be emphasized that the subject matter is quite novel and has not been widely presented in the literature yet. Moreover, we know only of single implementation cases, or rather attempts at implementation of the presented trends, in the practice of central banking. Meanwhile, the engagement of central banks in energy transition – especially in its indirect financing – is a political decision and involves, among others, the risk of reducing the autonomy of central banks. Widespread implementation of central bank digital currency, on the other hand, increases the importance of central banks as issuers, monetary and economic policy creators as well as depositaries. This also affects the model of banking sector operation, including reduction of the banks’ role and lesser importance of deposits as a source of banking activity financing. © 2022 Narodowy Bank Polski.

Cryptocurrencies are also transferred between investors. Cryptocurrency has become a new and attractive means of remittance. Thus, blockchain-based smart contracts also attract attention when central banks design digital currencies. However, it has been discovered that a significant amount of cryptoassets on blockchain are lost or stranded for a variety of reasons, including the loss of the private key or the owner's death. To address this issue, we propose a method for recoverable transactions that would replace the traditional transaction by allowing cryptoassets to be sent to a backup account address after a deadline has passed. We provide the computational workload required for our method by analyzing the prototype. The method proposed in this paper can be considered as a good model for digital currency design, including central bank digital currency (CBDC). © 2022 KSII","Blockchain; central bank digital currency (CBDC); cryptoasset; distributed ledger technology (DLT); smart contract","Bitcoin; Distributed ledger; Block-chain; Central bank; Central bank digital currency; Computational workload; Cryptoasset; Distributed ledg technology; Private key; Smart contract","","","","","Ministry of Health and Welfare, MOHW, (HI19C0785); Ministry of Health and Welfare, MOHW; Korea Health Industry Development Institute, KHIDI","This research was supported by a grant of the Korea Health Technology R&D Project through the Korea Health Industry Development Institute (KHIDI), funded by the Ministry of Health & Welfare, Republic of Korea (grant number : HI19C0785).","Iyer K., Dannen C., Building Games with Ethereum Smart Contracts, (2018); Moulton C.

A game is analyzed between a central bank (accounting for the government’s interest) and a representative household choosing to consume, hold CBDC, or hold non-CBDC. The central bank chooses negative interest rate when it realizes that the household is willing to pay the central bank for holding CBDC. The household pays the negative interest rate because of its Cobb Douglas preferences whereby it values holding CBDC while simultaneously holding the competitive non-CBDC with a given interest rate, consuming with various output elasticities, and accounting for transaction efficiencies and costs. More explicitly, intuition and how the players benefit are provided for the following results: The central bank chooses more negative interest rate when the household’s output elasticity for consumption increases, the household’s output elasticity for holding CBDC decreases, the CBDC and non-CBDC transaction efficiencies increase, the household’s transaction efficiency for consumption decreases, the household’s scaling of the transaction cost increases, the scaling parameter for the central bank’s profit per household decreases, the household’s monetary energy decreases, and the non-CBDC interest rate decreases. The results are determined analytically and illustrated numerically where each of nine parameter values is varied relative to a benchmark. © 2022 The Author(s).

However, exchanging and verifying information between the market participants and intermediaries is time consuming.In addition, the back office and coordination costs are very high. To address such challenges, blockchain technology has attracted the attention of researchers due to its potential as a new settlement system. In this study, we propose a blockchain-based settlement system using cross-chain atomic swaps that can be implemented for the central banks digital currency (CBDC). The proposed model adds an administrator ledger to the system to remove settlement failure and improve efficiency in market management. Along with our settlement system, we also propose a new lattice-based sequential aggregate signature scheme generally known for its advantage on resisting future quantum attacks. Proof-of-concept experiments with the proposed system were conducted to analyze the effect of numerous variables in the blockchain ecosystem on the settlement system. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","Blockchain-based settlement;

Most initiatives rely on Distributed Ledger Technologies and are presented as alternatives to physical cash. Consequently, anonymity-related regulatory questions have naturally started to arise in terms of Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing compliance. Against this backdrop, this paper provides a techno-legal taxonomy of approaches to balance privacy and transparency in CBDCs without thwarting accountability, but it also underlines cross-sectoral impacts. The contribution heeds regulation-by-design as its core methodological foundation, with Privacy-Enhancing Technologies as the relevant use case. Thus, it highlights that not only technology aids legal purposes, but also that some regulatory requirements ought to be designed into technology for one to reach agreed-upon results and/or standards.  © 2004-2012 IEEE.","Anonymity; Anti-money laundering; Central bank digital currency; Compliance; Criminal activities; Cryptocurrency; Law and technology; Policy; Regulation; Risk management","Data privacy; Distributed ledger; Job analysis; Risk assessment; Risk management; Terrorism; Anonymity; Anti-money laundering; Central bank; Central bank digital currency; Compliance.; Criminal activities; Cryptocurrency; Law; Law and technology; Privacy; Regulation; Risks management; Stakeholder; Task analysis; Transparency","","","","","Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (814177)","","Nakamoto S., Bitcoin: a Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System., 2008, (2008); Antonopoulos A.M., The Internet of Money, 2, (2017); Tapscott D., Euchner J., Blockchain and the Internet of Value: An interview with Don Tapscott Don Tapscott talks with Jim Euchner about blockchain, the Internet of Value, and the next Internet revolution, Res.

Which types of product attributes should central bank digital currencies have to be widely accepted? We answer this question by analyzing consumers’ acceptance of hypothetical payment methods. We used Japanese data from the 2019 Financial Literacy Survey to estimate a model of consumers’ ranking of the frequency of the use of five payment methods via three statistical models. The estimates of three models showed that the respondents to the survey value payment methods with shorter transaction times and mobile payment methods. Based on the estimates of these models, we conducted counterfactual simulations for the introduction of the hypothetical mobile version of noncash payment methods that required a shorter transaction time. We found that these hypothetical products would be the most frequently used payment methods on average; however, respondents with experience of financial troubles and with small financial asset holdings would use them less frequently. The results suggest that if the Bank of Japan wanted to issue a central bank digital currency that would be used almost every day as a replacement for cash, policy tools should be utilized to encourage the use of it by these groups as well. © 2021, Japanese Economic Association.","Attributes; Central bank digital currency; Characteristics approach; Demand for payment methods; Financial literacy","Japan; central bank; currency; digitization; finance; literacy; numerical model","","","","","Shinichi Fukuda; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, KAKEN, (18K01704)","Funding text 1: I thank Jozsef Molnar for sharing his work related to this draft.

However, CBDCs faces several political, technological, and legal challenges. We add a few more challenges that have not received much attention and summarize them in the extant literature. We then emphasize a broad version of money to examine its likely impact on financial stability. Moreover, using time series data of three leading economies and replying to past episodes’ evidence of financial innovation, the historical behaviour to incorporate the impact of CBDCs, and the velocity of circulation, we scrutinize the hypothetical influence of CBDCs on financial stability and inflation. This study employs McCallum's policy rule based on money growth, which deals with monetary policy. Our simulations indicate that the CBDCs do not produce higher inflation while setting financial stability at risk. This study also suggests the necessary policy implications. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Broad money; CBDC; Income; Interest rate; Velocity","","","","","","","","Agur M.I., Ari M.A., (2019); Ali R., Barrdear J., Clews R., Southgate J., Innovations in payment technologies and the emergence of digital currencies, Bank Engl.

An interest-bearing central bank digital currency could make the central bank’s monetary transmission direct, which could improve the efficiency of monetary policy. Furthermore, the asset could help to strengthen competition among banks and could support the spread of financial innovations. Risks related to the instrument, such as disintermediation, can be counterbalanced by the increasing deposit volumes due to higher interest rates after the introduction of the instrument, and by limits set on the maximum holdings of the asset.

Two typical application scenarios of CBDC are considered, namely the anonymous transaction scenario and real-name transaction scenario. First, starting from the interaction network of transactional groups, the degree distribution, density, and modularity of normal and money laundering transactions in two transaction scenarios are compared and analyzed, so as to clarify the characteristics and paths of money laundering transactions. Then, according to the two typical application scenarios, different transaction datasets are selected, and different models are used to train the models on the recognition of money laundering behaviors in the two datasets. Among them, in the anonymous transaction scenario, the graph convolutional neural network is used to identify the spatial structure, the recurrent neural network is fused to obtain the dynamic pattern, and the model ChebNet-GRU is constructed. The constructed ChebNet-GRU model has the best effect in the recognition of money laundering behavior, with a precision of 94.3%, a recall of 59.5%, an F1 score of 72.9%, and a micro-average F1 score of 97.1%. While in the real-name transaction scenario, the traditional machine learning method is far better than the deep learning method, and the micro-average F1 score of the random forest and XGBoost models both reach 99.9%, which can effectively identify money laundering in currency transactions.  © 2020 Tsinghua University Press.","behavior identification; central bank digital currency (CBDC); money laundering; transactional network","Convolutional neural networks; Laundering; Recurrent neural networks; Anonymous transaction; Application scenario; Behavior identifications; Central bank; Central bank digital currency; F1 scores; Interaction networks; Payment methods; Transactional network; Typical application; Learning systems","","","","","Financial Sustainable Development Research Team; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (61602536); Central University of Finance and Economics, CUFE","Acknowledgment This research was supported by the National Science Foundation of China (No. 61602536), the Emerging Interdisciplinary Project of Central University of Finance and Economics (CUFE), and Financial Sustainable Development Research Team.","Cheng P., Decoding the rise of central bank digital currency in China: Designs, problems, and prospects, Journal of Banking Regulation; Tiwari M., Gepp A., Kumar K., A review of money laundering literature: The state of research in key areas, Pacific Accounting Review, 32, 2, pp. 271-303, (2020); Jullum M., Loi A., Huseby R.B., Anonsen G., Lorentzen J., Detecting money laundering transactions with machine learning, Journal of Money Laundering Control, 23, 1, pp. 173-186, (2020); Weber M., Domeniconi G., Chen J., Weidele D.K.I., Bellei C., Robinson T., Leiserson C.E., Anti-money laundering in bitcoin: Experimenting with graph convolutional networks for financial forensics, (2019); Wright R., The hiding of wealth: The implications for the prevention and control of crime and the protection of economic stability, Journal of Financial Crime, 9, 3, pp. 239-243, (2002); Schneider F., Windischbauer U., Money laundering: Some facts, European Journal of Law and Economics, 26, 3, pp. 387-404, (2008); Sheikh F.E.R.A.E., Money laundering through underground systems and non-financial institutions, Journal of Money Laundering Control, 7, 1, pp. 9-14, (2003); Agarwal J.D., Agarwal A., International money laundering in the banking sector, Finance India, 18, 2, pp. 767-779, (2004); Buchanan B., Money laundering-A global obstacle, Research in International Business and Finance, 18, 1, pp. 115-127, (2004); Zdanowicz J.S., Trade-based money laundering and terrorist financing, Review of Law & Economics, 5, 2, pp. 855-878, (2009); Njagi L., Effectiveness of know your customer (KYC) policies adopted by commercial banks in Kenya in reducing money laundering and fraud incidences, (2009); Alarab I., Prakoonwit S., Nacer M.I., Comparative analysis using supervised learning methods for anti-money laundering in bitcoin, Proc. 2020 5th International Conference on Machine Learning Technologies, pp. 11-17, (2020); Alarab I., Prakoonwit S., Nacer M.I., Competence of graph convolutional networks for anti-money laundering in bitcoin blockchain, Proc. 2020 5th International Conference on Machine Learning Technologies, pp. 23-27, (2020); Chen Z., Soliman W.M., Nazir A., Shorfuzzaman M., Variational autoencoders and wasserstein generative adversarial networks for improving the anti-money laundering process, IEEE Access, 9, pp. 83762-83785, (2021); Senator T.E., Goldberg H.G., Wooton J., Cottini M.A., Khan A.F.U., Klinger C.D., Llamas W.M., Marrone M.P., Wong R.W.H., The FinCEN artificial intelligence system: Identifying potential money laundering from reports of large cash transactions, Proc.

Our model analyzes the optimal payment choice for consumers under various macroeconomic conditions. We determine that an individual economic agent chooses payment methods under specific conditions by incorporating policy interest rates on CBDCs and stablecoins used on cryptocurrency exchanges. We analyze the impacts of CBDCs and stablecoins on the choice of whether to use cash or deposits. We also examine how the agent changes her portfolio compositions in response to exogenous macroeconomic policies. If a government replaces cash with a CBDC, the convenience of digital currency would not affect consumer choices. The higher the government’s interest rate on CBDCs, the more consumers will use CBDCs than deposits. © 2022, The Author(s).","Central bank digital currency; Cryptocurrency; Payment portfolio model; Stablecoin","","","","","","University of Virginia, UV; Ministry of Education, MOE; National Research Foundation of Korea, NRF, (NRF-2022R1A2C1010596)","Funding text 1: This work was supported by the Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea and the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF-2022R1A2C1010596). ; Funding text 2: We appreciate helpful comments and discussions from Robert I.

However, the determinants of individuals’ behavioural intentions (BIs) toward using this financial technology are still unclear. Based on the integration of the technology acceptance model and innovation diffusion theory, this study develops a theoretical framework, which was validated through a questionnaire survey undertaken with 344 CBDC users from 10 pilot areas in China. The results suggest that the proposed theoretical framework is powerful for explaining individuals’ BIs to use CBDC. Furthermore, the results indicate that perceived usefulness, perceived security, and perceived ease of use, as well as awareness all positively and directly influence individuals’ BIs to use CBDC. Although perceived compatibility does not directly influence individuals’ BIs to use CBDC, its impact on individuals’ BIs to use CBDC is fully mediated by perceived security, perceived usefulness, and perceived ease of use. This study contributes to the CBDC literature by investigating individuals’ BIs to use CBDC. This study also offers important practical implications in fostering the application of CBDC. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","behavioural intention; Central bank digital currency; innovation diffusion theory; technology acceptance model","","","","","","","","Agarwal R., Prasad J.A., Conceptual and Operational Definition of Personal Innovativeness in the Domain of Information Technology, Information Systems Research, 9, 2, pp. 204-215, (1998); Agur I., Ari A., Dell'Ariccia G., Designing Central Bank Digital Currencies, Journal of Monetary Economics, 2, 4, pp. 1-18, (2021); Agur I., Bergara M., Bordo M.D., Cillo A., Engert W., Lis S.F.D., Fung B.S.C., Gnan E., Levin A.T., Diepelt D., Do We Need Central Bank Digital Currency?

This paper argues that public and private money need to coexist in order to get the best of both worlds, that is, trust and innovation. Getting the balance right, however, is no easy task. It requires a digital update of public money and the effective regulation of cryptos and stablecoins.

The rush of central banks all over the world toward CBDCs proof-of-concept studying and piloting in recent years, as well as somewhere already the practical implementation of their own digital currencies have been motivated by a number of factors that are analyzed in this study. The potential gains of CBDC domestic issue and application can be distinctly outlined today. But, the leading central banks, following to the basic principle “do no harm!”, are acting as carefully and slowly as possible in order to avoid the negative consequences of an abrupt shifts in the contemporary financial landscape. However, successful progress of the People’s Bank of China in piloting the digital yuan, as well as the launch of CBDCs in the Bahamas, Nigeria, Jamaica and the countries of the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States, not only stimulate other states to intensify their own research developments for CBDC, but also raise the question of future implementation of CBDCs for international settlements. The study’s key hypothesis, put forward by the author, is that the inevitable approaching issue of central bank digital currencies will create unique opportunities to enhance significantly the quality of settlement and payment systems not only domestically, but, and especially, internationally. CBDCs’ implementation for cross-border transactions will help to overcome the long-known but still unresolved hurdles of the existing archaic infrastructure of international settlements: low speed, high costs, limited access and insufficient transparency. © 2023 Saint Petersburg State University.

How will the CBDC affect the macroeconomy? Will its design matter? To answer these questions, we theoretically and quantitatively assess the effects of a CBDC on consumption, banking, and welfare. Our model captures the competition between different means of payments and incorporates a novel general equilibrium feedback effect from transactions to deposits creation. The general equilibrium effects of a CBDC are decomposed into three channels: payment efficiency, price effects, and bank funding costs. We show that a cash-like CBDC is more effective than a deposit-like CBDC in promoting consumption and welfare. Interestingly, a cash-like CBDC can also crowd in banking, even in the absence of bank market power. In a calibrated model, at the maximum, a cash-like CBDC can increase bank intermediation by 10.2% and welfare by 0.059%, and it can capture up to 23.3% of the payment market. We also discuss some lessons for designing a CBDC.

It is a virtual representation of the currency in the form of a digital token based on Decentralized ledger technology (DLT). The growing interest in cryptocurrency and the declining need for cash in payments have paved the way for CBDC since they offer solutions to the problems created by conventional cash. However, CBDC is still in its infancy and developing; not many countries have invested in this. This paper covers 14 CBDC projects and analyzes them according to different factors such as availability, operating model, transactions, architecture, framework, anonymity, and security. As the current work undertaken on CBDC is in the exploration stage, the analysis could be subject to change with time, as new technology and techniques emerge. In this study, various scholarly articles and reports were used to gain information about the current trend of CBDC and their different projects. Furthermore, we have examined the essence of a CBDC. © 2021 Totem Publishers Ltd.

The household chose which fractions of two currencies to hold, e.g., a national currency such as a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) and a global currency such as Bitcoin or Facebook’s Diem, and chose the tax evasion probability for each currency. The government chose, for each currency, the probability of detecting and prosecuting tax evasion, the tax rate, and the penalty factor imposed on the household when tax evasion was successfully detected and prosecuted. The household′ s fraction of the national currency, the government’s monitoring probability of the national currency, and the penalty factor imposed on the global currency, increased in the household′ s Cobb Douglas output elasticity for the national currency. The household′ s probabilities of tax evasion on both currencies increased in the government’s Cobb Douglas output elasticity for the national currency. The government’s taxation on both currencies decreased in the output elasticity for the national currency. High output elasticity for the national currency eventually induced the government to tax that currency more than the global currency. The household′ s probability of tax evasion on the global currency increased in the government’s output elasticity for that currency. The household was less (more) likely to tax evade on the national (global) currency if the government valued taxation and penalty on the national (global) currency. The results are illustrated numerically where each of the eight parameter values were varied relative to a benchmark. © 2021 by the authors.

Issues are addressed under general principles governing the interpretation of monetary laws in the context of evolving technologies and institutional arrangements. The article proposes a clear terminology to address the concepts underlying digital currencies and access to central bank money, and argues that a banknote may be 'written' electronically. The stance adopted in the article is critical of both account-based retail central bank digital currency and cryptocurrencies, and highlights the salient features of non-blockchain token-based alternatives. It sheds light on the considerations that influence the selection of a design that is appropriate from both the functional and legal perspectives.  © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.

While showing influential studies, important themes covered to date, and the intellectual structure of the CBDC literature, we present recent research trends, gaps, and future research agendas in this domain. Research curiosity on the systematical framework, significance, and structural implication of CBDC as a structural shift in the digitization of the monetary system are major propellants. CBDCs have far-reaching implications for monetary and payment systems, and their development could pave the way for a global common currency. Researchers are making significant efforts to investigate how CBDCs are linked to international trade and assets, particularly cryptocurrencies. There is much room for theoretical development, contextual coverage, and methodology contributions. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Bibliometric analysis; Bitcoin; CBDC; Content analysis; Cryptocurrency","","","","","","","","Abbassi W., Kumari V., Pandey D.K., What makes firms vulnerable to the Russia-Ukraine crisis?, J.

In February 2022 the Central Bank of Russia (CBR) launched its own pilot project of the digital Rouble. According to the CBR’s concept the digital Rouble’s platform (DRP) may be the first step to improvement of trans-border payments/ settlements including its potential integration with CBDC platforms of other countries. The author analyses the CBR’s concept and financial statistics to answer the question: can the digital Rouble increase usage of the Russian currency worldwide? Currently the Rouble is mainly used in trade settlements of Russia with Belarus (the share of the Rouble is 81 per cent) and Kazakhstan (62 per cent). In 2014 financial sanctions were imposed on Russia and the US Dollar transactions became unavailable for certain businesses. Since that moment the Russian Government made a lot of efforts to increase usage of the Rouble in foreign trade settlements, but the success was marginal. In general, the share of Rouble has increased, but it has seriously grown only in settlements for Russian exports to India – ​from 1.1 per cent in 2013 to 57.8 per cent in 2021. Despite Russia has an open financial account there is a number of obstacles for wider usage of the Rouble worldwide and they are as follows: Russia exports mainly raw materials, whose prices are denominated in the US Dollars; though last years the Russian government mainly borrowed in Roubles still at any convenient case it also borrows in other currencies; Russia has a big sovereign fund (over 10 per cent of its GDP), which is invested in non-Rouble papers; it is not rare happened that the state officials in public speeches advocate depreciation of the Rouble. Cumulatively the above mentioned issues lessen confidence in the Rouble and consequently decrease demand for it and its liquidity. Will the digital Rouble be immune to all of this? The author analysed its features and did not find anything that might help to overcome the abovementioned obstacles. There is also no evidence that the Russian Government may change its policy regarding the sovereign fund and other obstacles. Also, another serious threat for the digital Rouble may come from a new concept of the Russian Ministry of Finance, which advocates very soon inclusion of the cryptocurrency industry (CI) into the Russian financial system. Various countries, upon widening their experiments with the CBDC, begin to realise that the CI is a real threat to the CBDC. China is the first who has understood that there is a choice: either the CBDC or the CI, but not both. The CI already functions worldwide on a range of highly sophisticated and secure digital platforms. They cannot be really regulated by any country, though some governments have illusion that they can do this. The CBDC platforms will provide only in-country transactions at initial stage and connection between various CBDC platforms is a question yet. The CI platforms already operate globally and also give their users big anonymity, while this feature is something that the CBDC projects intend to exclude. Additional problem for Russia is that, given the low level of the Rouble internationalisation, in case the cryptocurrency industry would be legalised here, so this gives to local users much more interesting and developed instrument that yet to became feasible local digital currency. That’s why the author doubts that the digital Rouble will substantially increase the international role of the Russian currency in the near future. © 2022, Russian Academy of Sciences.

The e-Peso pilot plan, implemented between 2017 and 2018, could provide some key findings for central banks. In this sense, we can learn seven lessons from the e-Peso pilot plan: (i) reputation is key for central banks’ decision to introduce a CBDC; (ii) financial inclusion and cultural reasons are the main motivations; (iii) the technological solution as simple as possible; (iv) security aspects and traceable transfers are central for operational risk problems; (v) a token was a good solution for CBDC implementation; (vi) digital money was used for small payments and transfers; and (vii) CBDCs complement the existing means of payment. The conclusions highlight that CBDC choices are based not only on technical considerations but also on the cultural implications money use. The adoption of this new means of payment will be incremental but not reversible. © 2022 The Author(s)","CBDC; Central bank digital currency; Central banking; Digital currency; Digital money; Payment systems","","","","","","","","Adrian T.; Agur I., Ari A., Dell'Ariccia G., Central Bank Digital Currencies: Design Tradeoffs and Implications.""

We demonstrate two sub-frameworks: an evaluation sub-framework that provides consensus algorithm and operating architecture solutions and a verification sub-framework that validates the proposed solutions. Our framework offers a universal CBDC solution that is compatible with different national economic and regulatory regimes. The evaluation sub-framework generates customized solutions by splitting the consensus algorithms into several components and analyzing their impacts on CBDC systems. CBDC design involves a trade-off between system features - the consensus algorithm cannot achieve all system features simultaneously. However, we also improve the operating architectures to compensate for the weak system features. The verification sub-framework helps verify our proposed solution through empirical experiments and formal proof. Our framework offers CBDC designers the flexibility to iteratively tune the trade-off between CBDC system features for the desired solution. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to propose a framework to recommend and verify CBDC technical solutions.  © 2013 IEEE.","Central bank digital currency; consensus algorithm; evaluation sub-framework; operating architectures; verification sub-framework","Blockchain; Computer architecture; Data privacy; Economic and social effects; Electronic money; Scalability; Block-chain; Central bank; Central bank digital currency; Consensus algorithms; Evaluation sub-framework; License; On-line banking; Operating architecture; Privacy; Verification sub-framework; Iterative methods","","","","","","","Adrian T., Griffoli T.M., The Rise of Digital Money, (2019); Opare E.A., Kim K., A compendium of practices for central bank digital currencies for multinational financial infrastructures, Ieee Access, 8, pp. 110810-110847, (2020); Auer R., Cornelli G., Frost J., Rise of the central bank digital currencies: Drivers, approaches and technologies, Social Sci.

In addition, these currencies may also reduce consumers’ need for conventional demand deposits, which, in turn, increases banks’ loan provision costs because deposits require higher rates of return. We use a microeconomic banking model to investigate the effects of introducing an economy-wide, account-type CBDC on a bank’s loan supply and its failure risk. Given that a CBDC is expected to lower the cost of liquidity circulation and become a strong substitute for demand deposits, both the loan supply and the bank failure risk increase. These increases are countered by subsequent increases in the rates of return on term deposits and loans, which, in turn, reduce the loan supply and thus bank failure risk. These offsetting forces lead to no significant change in banking, as long as the rate of return on loans is below a certain threshold. However, once the rate is above the threshold, bank failure risk increases, thereby undermining banking stability. The problem is more pronounced when the degree of pass-through of funding costs to the loan rate is high and the profitability of a successful project is low. Our results imply that central banks wishing to introduce an economy-wide, account-type CBDC should first monitor yields on bank loans and consider policy measures that induce banks to maintain adequate liquidity reserve levels. © 2021, The Author(s).","Bank failure risk; Central bank digital currency; Loan supply","","","","","","Ministry of Education, MOE, (NRF-2020S1A5A8044620); National Research Foundation of Korea, NRF","We thank the Editor and two anonymous referees for valuable comments and suggestions.

Interoperability between heterogeneous blockchains has been an obstacle to service diversity and user convenience. Many types of cryptocurrencies are currently trading on the market, and many countries are researching and testing central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). In this paper, existing interoperability studies and solutions between heterogeneous blockchains and differences from the proposed service model are described. To enhance digital financial services and improve user convenience, transfer between heterogeneous cryptocurrencies, transfer between heterogeneous CBDCs, and transfer between cryptocurrency and CBDC should be required. This paper proposes an interoperable architecture between heterogeneous blockchains, and a decentralized peer-to-peer (P2P) service model based on the interoperable architecture for transferring between blockchain-based heterogeneous cryptocurrencies and CBDCs. Security threats to the proposed service model are identified and security requirements to prevent the identified security threats are specified. The mentioned security threats and security requirements should be considered when implementing the proposed service model. © 2022 by the authors.","blockchain; blockchain interoperability; central bank digital currency; cryptocurrency; decentralized finance; payment; transfer; virtual asset","Bitcoin; Blockchain; Cryptography; Security systems; Block-chain; Blockchain interoperability; Central bank; Central bank digital currency; Decentralised; Decentralized finance; Payment; Transfer; Virtual asset; Interoperability","","","","","Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning, MSIP; Institute for Information and Communications Technology Promotion, IITP","This research was implemented as part of the project “Standardization Lab. for Next-generation Cybersecurity” (Project Number: 2021-0-00112) supported by MSIT (the Ministry of Science and ICT) and IITP (Institute of Information & Communications Technology Planning & Evaluation).

In this paper we examine how potential users of CBDC technology willingly disclose their personal information. The researchers conducted an online quantitative survey which investigates the privacy perceptions of consumers. Using the privacy calculus theory lens, this study looks at the potential benefits of CBDC and how these influence user perceptions towards privacy disclosure. While this research suggests that participants in the study had negative perceptions in relation to the disclosure of personal information, many were willing to offset these concerns if there are significant benefits in the usage of CBDC. Factors such as ease of use, convenience, availability, and credibility were viewed as key benefits in this scenario. Thus, future banking strategies and marketing approaches need to consider these components to foster CBDC adoption. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","CBDC; Cryptocurrency; Digital currency; Fintech; Privacy","","","","","","","","Adrian T., Mancini-Griffoli T., The rise of digital money, Annu.

The share of cash in total payments is systematically decreasing, which poses the risk of being supplanted by other instruments, including cryptocurrencies. Central banks, therefore, faced the challenge of adjusting their issuing activities to the current social and market conditions, which resulted in the emergence of the concept and discussion of the introduction of digital cash. The purpose of this paper is to examine the abovementioned issues and indication of potential scenarios for the introduction of central bank digital currency with an indication of potential consequences for the banking sector. The thesis of this paper is the following statement: The emergence of digital money of the central bank may significantly change the nature of commercial banks' activities - including potentially eliminating their role in issuing cashless money.  © 2022 Patryk Kaczmarek, published by Sciendo.","cash; central bank digital currency; Central banking; checks; commodity money; cryptocurrencies; deposits","","","","","","","","Atako N., The interplay of privacy and transparency in fostering integrity in a CBDC vanderbilt, Journal of Entertainment & Technology Law, (2020); Ayuso J., Conesa C., Una introducción al debate actual sobre la moneda digital de banco central (CBDC) (An Introduction to the Current Debate on Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC))), Banco De Espana Occasional Paper No. 2005, (2020); Disscussion Paper, Central Bank Digital Currency Opportunities, Challenges and Design, (2020); Bindseil U., Tiered CBDC and the financial system, ECB Working Paper, 2351, (2020); Bjerg O., Nielsen R.H., Who Should Make Kroner? - A Review of Danmarks Nationalbank's Analysis of CBDC (CBS Working Paper), (2018); Bordo M.D., The Operation and Demise of The Bretton Woods System; 1958 to 1971 NBER Working Paper No. W23189, (2017); Choi K.J., Henry R., Lehar A., Reardon J., Safavi-Naini R., A Proposal for A Canadian CBDC, (2021); Dell'Erba M., Stablecoins in cryptoeconomics.

We present a model that captures a concern commonly raised in policy discussions: the option to hold CBDC can increase the incentive for depositors to run on weak banks. Our model highlights two countervailing effects. First, banks do less maturity transformation when depositors have access to CBDC, which leaves them less exposed to runs. Second, monitoring the flow of funds into CBDC allows policymakers to identify and resolve weak banks sooner, which also decreases depositors’ incentive to run. Our results suggest that a well-designed CBDC may decrease rather than increase financial fragility. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Bank runs; CBDC; Digital currency; Financial stability","","","","","","Economics of Central Bank; Office of Financial Research; Swiss National Bank","We thank seminar participants at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, the 2018 Annual Research Conference of the Swiss National Bank, the Bank of Canada/Riksbank Conference on the Economics of Central Bank Digital Currencies, and the virtual Economics of Digital Currencies Conference for their helpful comments.

A CBDC can be designed with attributes similar to cash or deposits, and can be interest bearing: a CBDC that closely competes with deposits depresses bank credit and output, while a cash-like CBDC may lead to the disappearance of cash. Then, the optimal CBDC design trades off bank intermediation against the social value of maintaining diverse payment instruments. When network effects matter, an interest-bearing CBDC alleviates the central bank's tradeoff. © 2021 International Monetary Fund","CBDC; Digital currency; Financial intermediation; Fintech; Network effects","","","","","","700 19th St NW, (20431); Bank of Israel, Cambridge University; Executive Board; Federal Reserve Board; International Myeloma Foundation, IMF; Bank of England; European Central Bank, ECB","We are particularly grateful to Narayana Kocherlakota, Carolyn Wilkins, and an anonymous referee.

However, CBDC face several challenges. They include: legal, technological, and political considerations. We summarize those challenges and add a few more that have not received much attention in the literature. We then focus on two forms of CBDC: a narrow version that only replaces notes and coins and a broader form with a deposit feature. The narrow CBDC is the most likely one to be first introduced. Next, relying on evidence of past episodes of financial innovation, and using cross-country data, we explore the hypothetical impact of CBDC on inflation and financial stability, based on the historical behaviour of the velocity of circulation and incorporating a CBDC's impact using McCallum's policy rule which sets the stance of monetary policy based on money growth. Our simulations suggest that CBDC need not produce higher inflation, but financial stability remains at risk. We provide some policy implications. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Central bank digital currency; McCallum rule; Monetary policy; Money demand; Velocity","","","","","","Hong Kong Institute for Monetary and Financial Research; Institute for Monetary and Financial Research or the Hong Kong Monetary Authority","Funding text 1: The second author is grateful to the Hong Kong Institute for Monetary and Financial Research for a Fellowship under their Thematic Research Programme.

The country is currently at fintech 1.0 stage and its banking system has only partially crossed the bank 4.0 threshold. Thus, overall, fintech in Japan is catching up with the levels of other developed and emerging economies even though the speed of the catch-up has increased in recent years. The paper highlighted the fact that development of fintech in Japan remains heterogenous in terms of market segments and major financial institutions promoting fintech services. The most developed segment of fintech in Japan is digital payments; neobanking and digital investment are raising in popularity even though they remain at the pre-maturing stages. Digitalisation of the financial sector is predominantly driven by the collaboration of large banks with fintech firms, which are establishing spillover effects and encouraging banks to further adopt digital technologies. The findings of this paper demonstrate that further promotion of DX in Japan’s financial sector will require future reforms in its corporate culture and regulatory environment. The problem of double shortages (the lack of financing for ICT and the lack of digital talents) shall also be addressed. The government has a big role to play in this process and needs to proactively stimulate cooperation among the private and financial sectors and fintech firms. © 2022, Association of Japanologists.

His theory has been widely adopted. However, it refers only to a special case, when inadequate public goods have to compete with the maximisation of private yield. The real tragedy of the commons is not that it is overused or neglected, nor is it any free-rider and spillover effects it gives rise to, but rather the underlying financial incentives and disincentives that prevent an adequate supply. Consequently, the misalignment between our current monetary system and the global commons has led to the latter’s erosion and partial destruction. Introducing a new monetary and fiscal policy of strategic triangulation can provide an adequate tool to finance our commons. With their ongoing central bank digital currency (CBDC) initiatives, regulators and central banks can offer a direct monetary mechanism to overcome this tragedy of the commons. © 2022, Politechnika Lubelska.

To this end, the paper examines recent progress in the domain of central bank digital currencies, and assesses the considerations and risks involved. In particular, it discusses the legislative considerations relating to the possible introduction of a digital euro, ie whether the European Union and its institutions are already endowed with the sovereignty necessary to issue a digital euro, or whether ad hoc legislative intervention is necessary to legitimise the issuance of such a new instrument. The paper then goes on to assess the risks and benefits associated with the issuance of a digital euro. Finally, it will analyse the possible forms that a digital euro could take, evaluating the pros and cons of each.The conclusions will highlight how the introduction of such a new instrument provides an opportunity to be seized and exploited. © Henry Stewart Publications,.","banking law; CBDC; central bank digital curren-cies; digital euro; digitisation","","","","","","","","Report on a Digital Euro, (2020); Eurosystem launches digital euro project, (2021); Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee of the Regions on a Digital Finance Strategy for the EU; Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on Markets in Crypto-assets, and amending Directive (EU) 2019/1937; European Central Bank; Eurosystem Report on the Public Consultation on a Digital Euro 2021, (2021); Digital Euro Experimentation Scope and Key Learnings, (2021); ERPB engagement in the digital euro investigation phase, (2021); Digital Euro Experimentation Scope and Key Learnings, (2021); Digital Euro: EBF Views, EBF paper #1: Strategic considerations, (2021); Call for expression of interest for digital euro front-end prototyping, (2022); Civil Society Seminar: Shaping the Digital Euro, (2022); Cipollone P., Il ruolo dell’euro digitale come àncora del sistema dei pagamenti, La Digitalizzazione degli strumenti finanziari: opportunità e rischi, (2021); Mooij A.

On the one hand, many critics recognise dangers to state currency sovereignty and the stability of the financial system; on the other hand, they fear negative developments regarding money laundering and the financing of terrorism. In addition, there are considerable concerns about an ever deeper erosion of privacy, consumer and data protection, which reaches a new dimension by linking such world currencies with already existing social networks governed and controlled by private entities. Under these circumstances, the chance of success of the Diem project clearly depends on the extent to which the aforementioned concerns can be dispelled and whether public trust can be established. Together with an overview of the developments of the Diem project since the inception of the underlying idea, the authors highlight the actors and their respective roles in an infrastructure primarily run and operated on distributed ledger technology (DLT), with computer nodes distributed across different jurisdictions. Moreover, it is argued that the level of control by end users over their digital representations and online footprints remains untested in the context of a worldwide digital financial infrastructure as proposed by Diem. The paper further elaborates and puts data protection and privacy of end users under scrutiny, outlining the need for a self-sovereign identity (SSI) management system in order to address the risks associated with correlation and profiling of individuals concerning their behaviour in payment systems. © 2021 Golnaz A.

However, since it began to get significant attention from academics and practitioners a few years ago, many concerns about how a central bank may build an efficient CBDC and how it would impact a country's current financial system still remain unanswered satisfactorily. Based on the combination of text mining and systematic review methods, this work presents a thorough literature assessment of 191 academic papers on CBDC in order to identify major research issues and knowledge gaps that may be addressed in the future. We find seven primary research themes linked to CBDC including (1) Central bank, (2) CBDC and other digital currency, (3) CBDC and money markets, (4) CBDC and monetary policy, (5) CBDC design and technologies, (6) CBDC and payment system, and (7) CBDC and financial stability and regulatory. The finding helps provide both overall and in-depth views of the current state of research in digital fiat currency topics, as well as drawing some important implications and suggestions on directions for the future research. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Blockchain; CBDC; Central bank digital currency; Frequency analysis; Literature review; Text mining; Topic modeling","","","","","","Đại học Kinh tế Thành phố Hồ Chí Minh, (2022-05-30-1007); Đại học Kinh tế Thành phố Hồ Chí Minh","This research is funded by University of Economics Ho Chi Minh City , Vietnam (UEH); Grant ID no. 2022-05-30-1007 .

This article argues that central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) offer a potentially highly efficacious solution to (i) the financial inclusion challenges of the PICs and (ii) the problem of high remittance costs that currently serve as a tax on the earnings of Pacific Islanders abroad. We identify the key challenges that may inhibit the rollout of CBDCs in PICs but argue that in time such a rollout is nonetheless highly likely–since the key drivers of CBDC development in the region are likely to be external to PICs themselves. While their potential is very significant, we conclude that now is not the time to issue a CBDC in the region, but it is the time to begin laying the groundwork for this innovation by developing the expertise required within the region’s central banks. © 2022 School of Law, City University of Hong Kong.","CBDC; central bank digital currency; financial inclusion; Pacific Island Countries","","","","","","Australian Research Council, ARC, (FL200100007)","Ross Buckley is the recipient of an Australian Research Council Laureate Fellowship [grant number FL200100007].

To illustrate this, I scrutinize the particular social, political and economic dimensions of the instituted process which have led to the launch of the digital yuan by the Chinese government in 2021. I also argue that the formulation of the digital yuan is specific to the particular contextual settings of China and their progress. Finally, I argue that the evolving role and long-term influence of the digital yuan in a global context is largely subject to the competition of the world’s major upcoming CBDCs like the U.S. dollar and euro. © 2023, Journal of Economic Issues / Association for Evolutionary Economics.","central bank digital currency; digital fait currency; digital yuan; instituted process; private digital currency","","","","","","","","Aysan A.F., Kayani F.N., “China’s Transition to a Digital Currency Does It Threaten Dollarization?, Asia and the Global Economy, 2, 1, (2022); Cukierman A., “Reflections on Welfare and Political Economy Aspects of A Central Bank Digital Currency.”, The Manchester School, 88, pp. 114-125, (2020); The Digital Dollar Project: Exploring a US CBDC.”, (2020); “The Age of the Appacus: In Fintech, China Shows the Way.”, The Economist, February 25, pp. 55-57, (2017); (2020); Galbraith J.K., The End of Normal: The Great Crisis and the Future of Growth, (2014); Goldstein J., Money: The True Story of a Made-up Thing, (2020); Grym A., Heikkinen P., Kauko K., Takala K., (2017); Haldane A.G., (2015); Huber T.A., Sornette D., Boom, Bust, and Bitcoin: Bitcoin-Bubbles as Innovation Accelerators, Journal of Economic Issues, 56, 1, pp. 113-136, (2022); Jones C., (2021); Koning J.P., (2014); Kshetri N., “China’s Digital Yuan: Motivations of the Chinese Government and Potential Global Effects.”, Journal of Contemporary China, (2022); Lupinu P.M., (2020); Mullan P.C., A History of Digital Currency in the United States: New Technology in an Unregulated Market, (2016); Nakamoto S., Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System, (2008); Polanyi K., The Economy as Instituted Process, Trade and Market in the Early Empires: Economies in History and Theory, pp. 243-270, (1957); Quiroz-Gutierrez M., Crypto is fully banned in China and 8 other countries, (2022); Raskin M., Yermack D., (2016); Siu R.C.S., “Corporate Planning and Innovation in an Economic Reform Context: The Case of Alibaba.”, Journal of Economic Issues, 55, 2, pp. 388-395, (2021); Siu R.C.S., “Evolution of Market Power in China’s Economic Reform and Its Anti-Monopoly Policy: The Case of Alibaba and Ant Financial Group.”, Review of Evolutionary Political Economy, (2022); Slawotsky J., “US Financial Hegemony: The Digital Yuan and Risks of Dollar De-Weaponization.”, Fordham International Law Journal, 44, 1, pp. 39-100, (2020); (2018); Ward O., Rochemont S., (2019); Xia M., “In Search of the Perfect Coin: China’s Approach Towards Cryptocurrency and Its Own Central Bank Digital Currency.”, Banking & Finance Law Review, 36, 3, pp. 419-456, (2021); Zhou X., “Zhou Xiaochuan: China’s choices for a Digital Currency System,”, (2021)","","","Routledge","","","","","","00213624","","","","English","J.

However, reduced frictions in global capital flows could also result in more capital flow and exchange rate volatility, which is of particular concern for emerging market economies.There will be greater competition among fiat currencies and certain private currencies such as stablecoins in their roles as mediums of exchange for payment and settlement of domestic as well as cross-border transactions. However, neither the advent of CBDCs nor the lowering of barriers to international financial flows will do much on their own to reorder the international monetary system or the balance of power among major currencies. Currencies such as the US dollar that are dominant stores of value will remain so because that dominance rests not just on the issuing country’s economic size and financial market depth, but also on a strong institutional foundation that is essential for maintaining investors’ trust in a currency. © The Author(s) 2023.

Drawing on recent IPE debates about the public-private nature of money, the critique of the “impossible trinity” and “territorial currencies,” this article explores the competition between China and the United States over and within the international monetary system. The two largest economies display strikingly divergent regulatory approaches to cryptocurrencies and Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC). China completely banned cryptocurrencies but became a front-runner in developing a CBDC. It aims to expand the RMB's global role without giving up its monetary control. U.S. administrations have instead reluctantly considered regulating cryptocurrencies. Discussions on a potential digital U.S. dollar (USD) only began in 2020. Washington aims at preserving the existing cross-border financial mechanisms and offshore infrastructure for USD-denominated transactions and credit creation. It focuses on financial crime and maintaining the innovation dynamic of its private sector to preserve its “exorbitant privilege.” Emerging financial infrastructures and standards for digital currencies are the new technological arena for U.S.–China monetary competition. © 2022 The Authors.

Cash usage at the point-of-sale decreased perceptibly in the past years mainly due to the ongoing trend towards digitalization. However, we show that there are also indications that consumers were somewhat pushed into cashless payments by government regulations and supply-side restrictions by commercial banks. Nonetheless, overall demand for euro cash remained strong and even increased relative to GDP since the financial crisis in 2008. In this pro-cess, however, we observe a supply-driven shift towards lower banknote denominations. Central banks all over the world are intensively thinking about the potential issue of CBDC as a substitute or complement to cash. Based on some of its preferred characteris-tics, we propose a double pre-paid scheme combining central elements of TARGET Instant Payment Settlement and electronic money features enabling offline and online instant payments. Since anonymity is categorically discarded by the ECB and as cash has some special advantages from a consumer perspective, the digital euro will rather co-cir-culate with cash than replace it in transactions. © 2022, Duncker und Humblot GmbH.

Built upon the relevant experience and research in other countries, China has been carefully designing its own version of digital currency and issuance mechanism with a purpose of not disrupting financial intermediation. Nevertheless, it still leaves some residual issues unanswered, in particular, the narrow bank concern and application scenarios. While this article proposes to use interest rates as a policy solution to mitigate the narrow bank concern, the ultimate success of CBDC still depends on market competition.

This paper proposes a Deep Neural Network (DNN) design to model the introduction of CBDC and its potential impact on commercial banks’ deposits. The model proposed forecasts the likelihood of the occurrence of bank runs as a function of the system characteristics and of the intrinsic features of CBDC. The success rate of CBDC and the impact on the banking sector is highly dependent on its design. Whether CBDC should carry any form of interest, if the amount of CBDC should be capped by account or if convertibility from banks’ deposits should be guaranteed by commercial banks are important features to consider. Further, the design of CBDC needs to contribute to enhancing the sustainability of the financial system, hence a CBDC design that promotes financial inclusion is paramount. The model is initially calibrated with Euro area system data. Results show that an increase in the financial system risk perception would trigger a significant transfer of wealth from bank deposits to CBDC, while the wealth transfer to CBDC is to a lesser extent also sensitive to its interest rate. © 2021 by the authors.

Accommodative monetary policies have also brought interest rates down to zero and/or negative territory as a mean to stimulate business investments. The recent rise of cryptocurrencies (The terms cryptocurrencies and crypto assets are used interchangeably.) poses, in turn, urgent challenges to central banks’ efforts to face the multiple pandemic-driven unprecedented consequences. Private currencies may lead to a relatively cashless society, thereby threatening central bank monopoly of issuance, a situation in which businesses, households and financial markets could lose access to risk-free central bank money. In addition, Decentralized Finance (DeFi) promises to transform the traditional financial system into an open, permission-less and autonomous financial system. The present paper discusses the rise of digital payments across the euro area, the spread of cryptocurrency trading and the intention of the European Central Bank (ECB) to issue a central bank digital currency (CBDC). We provide evidence on the existence of cointegration between selected cryptocurrencies, stablecoins and traditional financial assets. Both the rise of digital payments and the increased popularity of cryptocurrencies can be seen as the main drivers behind the prospective issuance of the digital euro, significantly affecting financial markets and business models alike. © 2022, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Associazione Amici di Economia e Politica Industriale.","CBDC; Cointegration; Cryptocurrencies; Decentralized Finance; Digital payments; Stableocoins","","","","","","","","Alfonso V., Boar C., Frost J., Gambacorta L., Liu J., E-commerce in the pandemic and beyond, BIS Bulletin, 2021, (2021); Aramonte S., Huang W., Schrimpf A., DeFi risks and the decentralisation illusion, BIS Quarterly Review, 2021, (2021); New forms of digital money., (2021); Barber M., Odean T., The Internet and the Investor, Journal of Economic Perspectives, 15, 1, pp. 41-54, (2001); Bech M., Garratt R., Central bank cryptocurrencies.

At the moment, the scope of purchase of digital money is predominantly the one of earnings expectation. Pursuant to article 1277 of Italian Civic Code, monetary obligations are discharged by means of currency which is legal tender in the country at the time of payment, for its nominal value. Contracts having digital currency as object are aleatory as a result of the intent of the parties. Legislators don't forbid the use of digital currencies, whose diffusion at the present moment is limited.

Based on a theoretical and policy-oriented approach, this article sheds light on a second public good with enormous practical relevance both for financial markets and institutions as well as for the general public that the Eurosystem, and ultimately the European Central Bank (ECB), must safeguard according to article 128 TFEU: the availability of ideal monetary objects for the public. While monetary policy constitutes the instrument used to keep prices stable, the availability of ideal monetary objects is ensured through the issuance of 'cash' that serves as both money with selected properties and an anchor for other monies of the same currency, including sight deposits at commercial banks. Today, the role of ideal monetary objects is (still) primarily fulfilled by tangible banknotes. As the use of tangible banknotes declines, however, a digital equivalent and complement-a digital euro-becomes increasingly necessary. Accordingly, the article concludes that the ECB is both entitled and obliged de lege lata to issue a digital euro on the basis of article 128 TFEU. It further explains that neither tangible cash nor a digital euro can simultaneously be used as instruments in themselves to maintain price stability. © The Author(s) 2021.

The main goal of the study was to review the CBDC economic development scenarios both domestically and internationally based on the assessment of the main features, advantages and risks of introducing this financial instrument into the modern monetary policy. The study considers the following three main characteristics of CBDC: a tool for domestic settlements, a single unit of account for the economic bloc of countries and a universal international digital currency. Each of these models was considered by the author in terms of the motivation of market participants, degree of readiness of the project and its compatibility with the existing financial system. Differentiation of models, depending on the payment architecture, the technological parameters and the implementation scale, allowed to conclude that currently there is no common understanding of the CBDC nature and economic advantages neither for individual countries nor for the international community as a whole. Noting the technological advantages of digitalization of the financial system, states are yet to answer the question of the CBDC implementation scale. Will it replace cash domestically or will it become a single international payment instrument? And are states ready today to consider such a possibility? The author concludes the study by substantiating the idea that in the next 35 years interest in the digital financial services sector will grow mainly in developing countries looking for a qualitative leap in the development of the digital financial services. As for the developed countries, those are neither objectively nor subjectively ready to change the already built and wellproven financial system, and therefore, given their weak interest in paradigm shifts, digital currency in the next 10 years will not be able to provide an alternative to the US dollar as a unit of international settlements. At the same time, there is a high probability of the CBDC development as a means of payment within the economic bloc of countries provided the unity of purpose of its participants. © 2021 Academic Educational Forum on International Relations.

More recently, the pandemic has also accelerated the digitalisation of payments and changed the general view of e-payment systems, not only in the EU but around the world. Consumers fear the risk of virus transmission and government directives to increase the number of non-cash payments have together resulted in a decrease in the amount of cash as a form of payment. At the same time, commercial entities in the private sector proceeded to issue new types of private digital currencies; stablecoins, in addition to bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. The decline of cash and the rise of new private digital currencies has pushed public authorities, especially central banks, to look for other alternatives, such as issuing new public central digital currencies. In order to increase the supply of payment services and provide the public with a different money delivery option as a result of changing payment habits, central banks around the world believe that issuing a central bank digital currency is increasingly likely. Like other regions, the Eurozone is no exception in terms of launching and testing its digital currency, the digital euro. The main concern is whether the Eurozone is ready to use this type of currency – whether technically or legally – and whether the digital euro will be used by consumers as the next form of payment. © 2022, Eotvos Lorand Tudomanyegyetem.

Design/methodology/approach: The methodology used in the analysis of significant recent events regarding the progress of central banks in establishing a CBDC and the implications for money laundering under a CBDC regime. This paper also reviews the literature regarding the Regulatory Dialectic to highlight potential innovative responses of money launderers to circumvent the controls generated through the implementation of a CBDC. Findings: This study examines the impact of Kane’s regulatory dialectic paradigm on the feasibility of money laundering under a CBDC regime and identifies potential avenues that would be available for those seeking to launder money, based on the form a CBDC would take. Research limitations/implications: This paper is unable as of yet to empirically evaluate anti-money laundering (AML) tactics under a CBDC regime as it has not yet been fully implemented. Practical implications: Many central banks worldwide are evaluating the structure of and introduction of a CBDC. There are a number of forms that a CBDC could take, each of which has implications for individual privacy and for entities involved in AML efforts within financial institutions and the regulatory community. The paper has implications for AML experts who are considering how AML procedures would change under a CBDC regime. Social implications: The regulatory dialectic predicts that regulatory response reactive, rather than proactive when it comes to socially undesirable phenomena. As central banks and governments seek to divert economic activity away from the laundering of the proceeds of illicit activity, there are tradeoffs in terms of a loss of privacy. The regulatory dialectic predicts a corresponding innovative response of those who wish to undermine the controls generated through the establishment of a CBDC. Originality/value: To the authors’ knowledge, this is the first paper to explore the impact of a potential CBDC on money laundering and the potential innovative circumventions within the paradigm of the Regulatory Dialectic. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Central bank; Central bank digital currency; Digital coin; Internal controls; Money laundering; Privacy; Regulatory dialectic; Secrecy","","","","","","","","Auer R., Cornelli G., Frost J., Rise of the Central bank digital currencies: drivers, approaches and technologies.

Public banking is not a new idea and it’s enjoying newfound popularity alongside the rise of modern monetary theory (MMT) and the emergence of a new generation of financially aware and digitally enabled researchers, “conspiracy theorists” and activists. So while these days cryptocurrencies are trumpeted as the cutting edge of alternative monetary technologies, I suggest that public banking is the money technology best able to respond to the democratic desires of today’s citizens. I conclude with a discussion of the development of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) and the ways they are being used to undermine local, community-led self-determination by further centralizing monetary control in the centrally controlled system of central banks whose mandate is to serve private interests. © University of Toronto Press, 2022.","Bank for International Settlements; CBDC; central banks; communication; community banking; digital currencies; public banking","","","","","","Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, SSHRC, (2013-16)","Much of our nation’s post-war economic growth and infrastructure development was funded by our own public Bank of Canada, which is authorized","Abrahamian Atossa Araxia, The Rock-Star Appeal of Modern Monetary Theory: The Sanders Generation and a New Economic Idea, The Nation, (2017); Adrian Tobias, Stablecoins, Central Bank Digital Currencies, and Cross-Border Payments: A New Look at the International Monetary System, IMF, (2019); Aglietta Michel, A Theory of Capitalist Regulation: The US Experience, (1979); Alcoba Natalie, Bank of Toronto for the People, National Post, (2011); Andrianova Svetlana, Public Banks and Financial Stability, Economics Letters, 116, 1, pp. 86-88, (2012); Babe Robert E., Commentary: Cultural Studies and Political Economy, TOPIA, 9, pp. 3-13, (2003); (2020); COVID-19: Actions to Support the Economy and Financial System, (2020); Contingency Planning for a Central Bank Digital Currency, (2020); The Road to Digital Money, (2020); Belke Ansgar, Beretta Edoardo, From Cash to Central Bank Digital Currencies and Cryptocurrencies: A Balancing Act between Modernity and Monetary Stability, Journal of Economic Studies, 47, 4, pp. 911-938, (2020); Bell Stephanie, Do Taxes and Bonds Finance Government Spending?, Journal of Economic Issues, 34, 3, pp. 603-620, (2000); Benes Jaromir, Kumhof Michael, IMF Working Paper: The Chicago Plan Revisited, (2012); Berman David, Going Cashless: How Far Will Canadians Go in Parting with Their Bills and Coins?, The Globe and Mail, (2019); Bindseil Ulrich, Central Bank Digital Currency: Financial System Implications and Control, International Journal of Political Economy, 48, 4, pp. 303-335, (2019); BIS Innovation Hub to Expand to New Locations in Europe and North America, (2020); Bimonthly Meetings, (2014); Block Fred, Redefining socialism: Karl Polanyi and the democratization of finance, (2015); Bougrine Hassan, Seccareccia Mario, Money, Taxes, Public Spending, and the State within a Circuitist Perspective, International Journal of Political Economy, 32, 3, pp. 58-79, (2002); Braun Benjamin, Speaking to the People?

It introduces their current status, and how several countries and currency areas are considering their implementation, following in the footsteps of the Bahamas (which has already implemented them in its territory), China (which has already completed two pilot tests) and Uruguay (which has completed a pilot test). First, the sample of potential candidate countries for establishing a CBDC was selected. Second, the motives for implementing a CBDC were collected, and variables were assigned to these motives. Once the two previous steps had been completed, bivariate correlation statistical methods were applied (Pearson, Spearman and Kendall correlation), obtaining a sample of the countries with the highest correlation with the Bahamas, China, and Uruguay. The results obtained show that the Baltic Sea area (Lithuania, Estonia, and Finland) is configured within Europe as an optimal area for implementing a CBDC. In South America, Uruguay (already included in the comparison) and Brazil show very positive results. In the case of Asia, together with China, Malaysia also shows a high correlation with the three pioneer countries, and finally, on the African continent, South Africa is the country that stands out as the most optimal area for implementing a CBDC. © 2021 by the authors.

Virtual assets began to be used for settlement, capital accumulation, and speculative income, which creates competition with state fiat money, to the state monopoly of the central banķ on money issuance and potentially rise a threat to financial stability. The purpose of the article is to assess the current state and development potential of both state and non-state virtual assets, their role in money circulation, and the potential impact on the monetary and credit system of Uķraine in the context of the possible launch of the central banķ digital currency - the e-hryvnia. The article presents the main forms of virtual assets and defines their characteristics, evaluates the possibility of their usage for settlements, and the potential for partial or complete replacement of fiat money in cash or non-cash forms. It is proven that nowadays the main restraining factor for the acquisition of money functions by virtual assets are the insufficient prevalence of technological means for carrying out transactions, the high volatility of their prices, and legislative limits. It is determined that technically some retail virtual assets can acquire all money qualities and conceptually differ only in the issuer and the system of centralization: public or private issuer, centralized or decentralized system. Furthermore, it has been proven that the introduction of the e-hryvnia into circulation as a monetary policy tool with interest accrual would significantly strengthen the interest channel of monetary transmission, contribute to the achievement of central banķ targets, and hence to non-inflationary monetization of the economic growth. At the same time, the introduction of the third form of money would probably give rise to new risķs, which are proposed to be mitigated by proper parameterization of the new form of money. © 2022 by the author(s).","central banķ digital currency; cryptocurrency; financial inclusion; monetary policy; monetization of the economy; money in circulation; stablecoin; virtual assets","","","","","","","","Merinova S.

As a result, societies are losing a critical public retail payment option, and retail consumers are losing important rights associated with using cash. To address this concern, we propose an approach to digital currency that would allow people without banking relationships to transact electronically and privately, including both e-commerce purchases and point-of-sale purchases that are required to be cashless. Our proposal introduces a government-backed, privately-operated digital currency infrastructure to ensure that every transaction is registered by a bank or money services business, and it relies upon non-custodial wallets backed by privacy-enhancing technology, such as blind signatures or zero-knowledge proofs, to ensure that transaction counterparties are not revealed. Our approach to digital currency can also facilitate more efficient and transparent clearing, settlement, and management of systemic risk. We argue that our system can restore and preserve the salient features of cash, including privacy, owner-custodianship, fungibility, and accessibility, while also preserving fractional reserve banking and the existing two-tiered banking system. We also show that it is possible to introduce regulation of digital currency transactions involving non-custodial wallets that unconditionally protect the privacy of end-users. © 2021 by the authors.

However, access to cash is not always guaranteed, especially in rural regions. The present study is based in the Ávila region of Spain. A parameter called the ""access to cash index"" is constructed here. It is used to detect rural areas where the ability to access cash and banking services is more difficult. Based on the ""access to cash index"", two sustainable solutions are proposed: The first (in the short term), based on extending access to cash, takes advantage of the existing pharmacy network. With this measure, a notable reduction of more than 55% of the average distance required to access this service is verified here. The second is based on the implementation of a central bank digital currency. Here, the results show an acceptance of 75%. However, it is known that elderly people and those without relevant education and/or low incomes would reject its widespread use. Such a circumstance would require the development of training and information policies on the safety and effectiveness of this type of currency. © 2020 by the authors.","Central bank digital currency; Financial inclusion; Pharmacy network; Social sustainability; Sustainable access to cash; Sustainable development; Sustainable solutions; Vulnerable rural areas","Avila [Avila (PRV)]; Avila [Castilla y Leon]; Castilla y Leon; Spain; banking; central bank; elderly population; health services; index method; network analysis; rural area; safety; sustainable development; training; vulnerability; World Bank","","","","","AAUCAV; Asociación de Amigos de la UCAV; Catholic University of America, CUA","Funding text 1: The APC was funded by the incentive granted to the authors by the ""Asociación de Amigos de la UCAV""-Catholic University of Ávila.

While commercial banks could use these new technologies to manage wholly digital versions of existing fiat currencies, the low cost and widespread availability of those technologies mean that organisations other than nation states can also think about creating digital currencies. This paper builds on a previous paper that explored who these organisations might be (the ‘5Cs framework’) and investigated their motivations, to look at two specific and con-trasting proposals that move these discussions from theoretical to actual policy concerns.These examples are taken from the private sector (Facebook’s Libra) and the public sector (the People’s Bank of China digital currency). The paper argues that the com-petition between these digital currencies is about hegemony not hash rates, and that shifts in the tec-tonic plates of economic power ultimately result in earthquakes that change the landscape of political power. © Henry Stewart Publications,.","Central bank digital currency; Cryptocurrency; Digital money; Electronic money; Fiat currency; Monetary policy; Synthetic currency","","","","","","","","‘What comes after Bretton Woods II, Economist, (2019); Eyers J., ASIC’s Greg Medcraft says that traditional bank accounts may be obsolete in a decade, Australian Financial Review, (2017); Kaminska I., Central bank group BIS taps Benoit Cœuré to lead digital currency push, Financial Times, (2019); King M., Heroes and villains: The role of central banks, The End of Alchemy’, pp. 156-210, (2016); Birch D., Who will make money?

These risks, which stem from sudden shifts in money demand and supply, are as follows: (I) risk of a cashless society; (II) risk of structural bank disintermediation; (III) risk of systemic bank runs; (IV) risk of currency substitution; and (V) risk of economic and financial bubbles. This framework will guide the assessment of the central bank digital currencies (CBDC), which are considered as the next step in monetary evolution. We will analyze two large groups of CBDC proposals: (i) proposals aimed at complementing cash and bank deposits; and (ii) proposals aimed at replacing all bank deposits with CBDCs. We find that once CBDCs are issued in both sets of proposals, there is always a trade-off between low levels of (I), (IV), (V), risks and high levels of (II) risk. This trade-off could also be defined as the CBDC dilemma, which states that in most CBDC proposals it is impossible to have both of the following at the same time: (1) low levels of (I), (IV) and (V) risks; and (2) low levels of (II) risk. Finally, we suggest that further research on CBDCs should focus on the second group of proposals on a phase-in basis in order to also mitigate the structural bank disintermediation risk and hence to overcome the CBDC dilemma. © 2020 by the authors.

It is imperative for central banks to promote the issuance of central bank digital currency (CBDC). Based on initial achievements of research on digital fiat currency (DFC) conducted by the People's Bank of China, this paper explores a closed loop which encompasses DFC issuance, transfer and return in the ""central bank-commercial banks"" binary model. Moreover, the paper designs the encrypted character string of CBDC, the issuance/return mechanism based on a 1:1 exchange ratio between deposit reserve and DFC, and the conversion mechanism of CBDC during its transfer. The paper goes on to explore the overall architecture, system architecture and technical architecture of the prototype and discusses possible ways to improve the usability of distributed ledger technology (DLT) based on partial application of DLT. Finally, this paper explores data analysis of CBDC under the prerequisite of consumer privacy protection, and concludes that consensus of distributed ledger and SM2 algorithm are key factors influencing the performance of CBDC transfer. Some suggestions for further improvement are also offered. © Copyright 2018, Institute of Software, the Chinese Academy of Sciences.

This article intends to explain the construction of the e-CNY and discuss its likely implications. While PBC tried hard to avoid causing disintermediation of commercial banks, it remains to be seen if there will be a shift from commercial banks savings accounts to the new e-CNY wallets. E-CNY’s impacts on existing mobile payment system and the associated collection and analyses of big data in the Fintech sector could be major. In summary, even the modest step of creating e-CNY could significantly transform the financial landscape in China.

These one-off and recurring payments revealed the shortcomings of existing financial infrastructures even as electronic payments replaced cash for everyday expenses. Delays in getting government payments to citizens in many countries focused attention on the potential benefits of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). This article outlines the social and economic policy choices involved in designing a CBDC and the consequences of these choices for privacy. Priorities including preventing the criminal abuse of the financial system, geopolitical concerns and private sector innovation compete with, and potentially undermine, privacy. We identify and categorize four key privacy risks as ‘losses’ associated with current CBDC models: loss of anonymity, loss of liberty, loss of individual control, and loss of regulatory control. © The Author/s 2021","CBDC; Central Bank Digital Currency; COVID-19; data protection; pandemic; privacy","","","","","","Australian Government; Australian Research Council, ARC, (FT190100372); RMIT University, RMIT; University of Melbourne, UNIMELB","The authors thank the reviewers for their helpful comments and Dr Geraldine Carney, University of Melbourne, and Mr Campbell McNolty, RMIT University, for their research assistance.

Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies bear a significant resemblance to base money or central bank money. This functional similarity can potentially pose several challenges to central banks in various dimensions. It may pose risks to central banks’ monopoly over issuing base money, price stability, the smooth operation of payment systems, the conduct of monetary policy, and to the stability of credit institutions and the financial system. From among several potential policy responses, central banks have been investigating and experimenting with issuing central bank digital currency (CBDC). This paper investigates CBDC from a legal perspective and sheds light on the legal challenges of introducing CBDC in the euro area. Having studied the potential impact of issuing CBDC by the European Central Bank (ECB), particularly on the banking and financial stability, the efficient allocation of resources (i.e. credit), as well as on the conduct of monetary policy, the paper concludes that issuing CBDC by the ECB would face a set of legal challenges that need to be resolved before its issuance at the eurozone level. Resolving such legal challenges may prove to be an arduous task as it may ultimately need amendments to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. © 2019, Springer Nature Limited.","Bitcoin; Central bank; Central bank digital currency; Cryptocurrency; European Central Bank; Money","","","","","","","","Prasad E.S., Gaining Currency: The Rise of the Renminbi, (2017); Kindlebergeraliber C.P.R.Z., Manias, Panics, and Crashes: A History of Financial Crises, (2005); Wolman D., The End of Money: Counterfeiters, Preachers, Techies, Dreamers–and the Coming Cashless Society, (2012); Weber W.E., Government and Private e-Money-Like Systems: Federal Reserve Notes and National Bank Notes, Bank of Canada Working Paper 2015–18., (2015); Selgin G.A., Good Money: Birmingham Button Makers, the Royal Mint, and the Beginnings of Modern Coinage, 1775–1821, (2011); White L.H., Competing Money Supplies, (2018); Narayananclark A.J., Bitcoin’s academic pedigree, Communications of the ACM, 60, 12, pp. 36-45, (2017); Wirdum A.V., The Genesis Files: If Bitcoin Had a First Draft, Wei Dai’s B-Money Was It, (2018); Wirdum A.V., The Genesis Files: How David Chaum’s eCash Spawned a Cypherpunk Dream, (2018); van Wirdum A., The Genesis Files: Hashcash or How Adam Back Designed Bitcoin’s Motor Block, (2018); Haan C., Verge, Bitcoin Gold and MonaCoin Hacked, Crowdfund Insider, (2018); Szabo N., Money, Blockchains, and Social Scalability, Unenumerated, (2017); Nakamoto S., Bitcoin: A Peer-To-Peer Electronic Cash System, (2008); Auer R., Beyond the Doomsday Economics of “Proof-of-Work” in Cryptocurrencies, BIS Working Papers No 765., (2019); Research B., A Complete History of Bitcoin’s Consensus Forks, (2017); Poondryja J.T., The Bitcoin Lightning Network: Scalable Off-Chain Instant Payments, (2016); Antonopoulos A.M., Mastering Bitcoin: Programming the Open Blockchain, (2017); Abadibrunnermeier J.M., Blockchain Economics, National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper 25407., (2018); Burniske C., Tatar J., Cryptoassets: The Innovative Investor’s Guide to Bitcoin and Beyond, (2018); Berentsenschar A.F., A Short Introduction to the World of Cryptocurrencies.

However, a gap in research effort between practitioners and academics seems to have emerged. This paper analyses and maps that gap by exploring trends in peer-reviewed research contributions through thematic categorisation of academic literature on Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) use-cases for services, operations and functions performed by central banks. Furthermore, this paper provides summaries of opportunities and challenges for central banks arising from blockchain adaptation to each of those use-cases. To achieve this goal, we utilise a Systematic Mapping Study approach. The paper presents an in-depth assessment of statistical and thematic analysis of research maturity and the types of researchers, with specific emphasis on types of central bank use-cases considered for blockchain adaptation. Our work contributes to an understanding of where the most or least attention is directed, allowing for identification of gaps and opportunities for both academics, practitioners and combinations of each. Results show that the research topic is a comparatively new domain. It confirms the gap between depth and volume of the research provision from industry and academia, with industry leading the trend. Our study also found that the most research-intensive use-cases are those for: 1) Central Bank issued Digital Currency (CBDC), 2) Regulatory Compliance and 3) Payment Clearing and Settlement Systems (PCS) operated by central banks; a comparatively low engagement was found in the areas of 4) Assets Transfer/Ownership and 5) Audit Trail.  © 2013 IEEE.","assets ownership; Assets transfer; audit trail; blockchain; CBDC; central bank; central bank digital currency; challenges; distributed ledger technology; DLT; financial regulation; literature review; mapping study; opportunities; payment clearing and settlement; PCS; regulatory compliance; research maturity; research trend; use-case","Mapping; Regulatory compliance; Academic literature; Depth assessment; Paper analysis; Research efforts; Research topics; Settlement systems; Systematic mapping studies; Thematic analysis; Blockchain","","","","","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, EPSRC, (EP/R512497/1); Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, EPSRC","The work of Natalia Dashkevich was supported by a Ph.D. Studentship from the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC), U.K., under Grant EP/R512497/1.","Judmayer A., Stifter N., Krombholz K., Weippl E., Blocks and chains: Introduction to bitcoin, cryptocurrencies, and their consensus mechanisms, Synth.

This paper discusses the expectations that e-cash would need to meet, from a user perspective, and argues that e-cash would need to have more in common with modern account-based electronic and mobile account payments than with traditional cash. Were central banks to launch e-cash, they would be in direct competition with private payment services. A successful e-cash service would therefore require a competitive edge over private electronic payment services. This would create a risk of market distortion for both payments and deposit services. Regulatory issues such as know-your-customer requirements and account/transaction liabilities would play a major role in e-cash services. Central bank e-cash would have to fulfil the basic payment instrument requirements of a sufficiently large segment of the payments market. © Henry Stewart Publications, 1750-1806.","Central bank digital currency; Digital cash; E-cash; Electronic legal tender; Electronic payment instrument regulation","","","","","","","","Barontini C., Holden N., Proceeding with Caution — a Survey on Central Bank Digital Currency, (2019); Griffoli T.M., Peria M.S.M., Agur I., Ari A., Kiff J., Popescu A., Rochon C., Casting Light on Central Bank Digital Currency, (2018); Payment Patterns in Sweden, (2018); Aleksi Grym A., Heikkinen P., Kauko K., Takala K., Central bank digital currency’, Bank of Finland Economic Review Paper 5/2017, (2017); Report on the Definition, Scope and Effects of Legal Tender of Euro Banknotes and Coins; Directive (EU) 2015/2366 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 November 2015 on Payment Services in the Internal Market, Amending Directives 2002/65/EC, (2015); Directive 2014/92/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 July 2014 on the Comparability of Fees Related to Payment Accounts, Payment Account Switching and Access to Payment Accounts with Basic Features, (2014)","H.

However, compared with existing cryptocurrencies, CBDC needs a more controllable decentralization and more emphasized supervision. Therefore, the critical part of CBDC is the network architecture that saves computing resources, the technical scheme that is in line with economic ecology, and efficient consensus algorithms. In this paper, we propose a hybrid blockchain system with a modularity network for CBDC. The account scheme is used to record frequently circulated digital currencies, especially for massive small payment transactions when the digital assets and smart contracts with large value fluctuations and weak liquidity are recorded using the Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) scheme. In terms of network architecture, a modular blockchain architecture is proposed, and a sliced data storage solution is designed to enhance the concurrency of this structured network. We also proposed a CBDC supervision mode for blockchain, and on this basis, the DPOS-BFT algorithm is optimized, which reduces the two rounds of consensus of the original algorithm to one round. Finally, three simulation experiments on scheme, network, and consensus are carried out, which show this system can comprehensively improve the transaction processing and the consensus speed. © 2013 IEEE.","blockchain; Central bank digital currency; consensus mechanism; modular architecture; prototype system","Blockchain; Digital storage; Electronic money; Computing resource; Consensus algorithms; Economic constructions; Original algorithms; Payment transactions; Structured networks; Technical scheme; Transaction processing; Network architecture","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (61774021, 61911530133); Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, BUPT, (IPOC2019ZT07); State Key Laboratory of Information Photonics and Optical Communications, SKLIPOC","This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 61774021 and Grant 61911530133, and in part by the Fund of State Key Laboratory of Information Photonics and Optical Communications through the Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, China under Grant IPOC2019ZT07.","Courtland R., Virtual currency gets real, IEEE Spectr, 49, 6, pp. 52-53, (2012); Bech M.L., Garratt R., Central bank cryptocurrencies, BIS Quart.

While having access to digital currency is more convenient than having to travel to an automated teller machine, this only makes digital currency as convenient as a bank debit card — not better. Demand for digital currency will thus be weak in countries where the adoption of cash substitutes (eg cards, electronic money, mobile phone payments) has suppressed demand for cash. By contrast, where cash use is high due to a lack of substitutes, demand for digital currency should be stronger. Building on the observation that demand for CBDC is tied to the current level of cash use, this paper uses four measures to assess trends in the demand for cash in 11 countries. A tentative forecast of cash use is also made. After showing that declining cash use is largely associated with demographic change, the study ties the level of cash use to the likely demand for CBDC in different countries. In this process, it is suggested that one measure of cash use is more useful than the others. © Henry Stewart Publications, 1750-1806.","Cash forecasting; Cash use; Central bank digital currency","","","","","","","","Riksbank S., The Riksbank’s E-Krona Project, (2017); Central Bank Digital Currencies, (2018); Bech M., Faruqui U., Ougaard F., Picillo C., Payments are a-changin’ but cash still rules, BIS Quarterly Review, pp. 67-80, (2018); Humphrey D., Kaloudis A., Owre G., The future of cash: Falling legal use and implications for government policy, Journal of International Financial Markets, Institutions and Money, 14, 3, pp. 221-233, (2004); Khiaonarong T., Humphrey D., Cash Use across Countries and the Demand for Central Bank Digital Currency, (2019); This Measure Does Not Include Cashback at the POS and There is No Information on the Value of Cash Withdrawn and Held Idle for Hoarding Or Precautionary Purposes; Meade N., Islam T., Forecasting with growth curves: An empirical comparison, International Journal of Forecasting, 11, 2, pp. 199-215, (1995); Khiaonarong T., Humphrey D., Use and substitution of cash and electronic payments in Asia, South East Asian Central Banks Research and Training Center, Occasional Paper No. 42, (2005); Ali R., Barrdear J., Clews R., Southgate J., The economics of digital currencies, Bank of England Quarterly Bulletin, pp. 276-286, (2014); Barrdear J., Kumhof M., The Macroeconomics of Central Bank Issued Digital Currencies, (2016); Central Bank Digital Currency in Denmark?, (2017); Engert W., Fung B., ‘Central Bank Digital Currency: Motivations and Implications, (2017); Mancini-Griffoli T., Peria M., Agur I., Ari A., Kiff J., Popescu A., Rochon C., Casting Light on Central Bank Digital Currency, (2018); Central Bank Digital Currencies, (2018); van Hove L., Why electronic purses should be promoted’, Banking and Information Technology, 7, 2, pp. 20-31, (2006)","","","Henry Stewart Publications","","","","","","17501806","","","","English","J.

But there is not yet a clear idea and blueprint of what DFC looks like. This paper establishes a systematic framework to analyze the essence and connotation of DFC from four dimensions: currency value, technical aspects, means of implementation and application scenarios. It is argued that DFC is a credit-based currency in terms of value, a crypto-currency from a technical perspective, an algorithm-based currency in terms of implementation and a smart currency in application scenarios. Compared with existing private digital currencies and electronic currencies, DFC will be equipped with brand new and higher qualities. The goal of Chinese DFC is to contribute to more stable value, more secure data, more powerful regulation, stronger empowerment of individuals in payment activities and smarter application. Chinese DFC should have qualities that enable it to provide better service for the public, to offer effective tools for macroeconomic control and to lay a solid foundation for RegTech development. © 2018, Science China Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","algorithm-based currency; central bank digital currency; credit-based currency; crypto-currency; digital fiat currency; smart currency","Industrial research; Research and development management; Application scenario; Central bank; credit-based currency; digital fiat currency; Electronic currency; Research and development; smart currency; Systematic framework; Electronic money","","","","","","","Digital Currencies, Bank for International Settlements, (2015); Interview with Zhou Xiaochuan — Zhou Xiaochuan, the governor of the central bank, talking about RMB exchange rate reform, macro prudential framework and digital currency (in Chinese)Caixin Weekly, 6, pp. 52-61, (2016); Broadbent B., Central banks and digital currencies, (2016); Fan Y.F., Theoretical basis and structural selection of China’s digital fiat currency (in Chinese), China Finance, 17, pp. 10-12, (2016); Yao Q., Consideration on China’s digital currency design (in Chinese), China Finance, 12, pp. 26-27, (2016); Yao Q., Digital currency and bank account (in Chinese), Tsinghua Financ Rev, 7, pp. 63-67, (2017); Koning J.P., Evolution in cash and payments: comparing old and new ways of designing central bank payments systems, cross-border payments networks, and remittances, R3 Reports, (2017); Bordo M.D., Levin A.T., Central bank digital currency and the future of monetary policy, NBER Working Paper 23711, (2017); Bech M.L., Garratt R., Central bank cryptocurrencies, BIS Quarterly Review, (2017); Yao Q., Theoretical and technical logic of legal digital fiat currency (in Chinese), Comp Stud, 4, pp. 179-196, (2017); Yao Q., Tang Y.W., Some thoughts on central bank digital currency (in Chinese), Financ Res, 7, pp. 78-85, (2017); Yao Q., Conceptual prototype of Chinese digital fiat currency (in Chinese), China Finance, 17, pp. 13-15, (2016); Chaum D., Blind signatures for untraceable payments, Advances in Cryptology — Crypto 82, pp. 199-203, (1983); Dai W., B-Money, (1998); Jakobsson M., Juels A., Proofs of work and bread pudding protocols, Proceedings of Conference on Communications and Multimedia Security, Leuven, pp. 258-272, (1999); Szabo N.B., Gold unenumerated: an unending variety of topics, (2008); Nakamoto S., Bitcoin: a peer-to-peer electronic cash system, (2008); A canadian experiment with distributed ledger technology for domestic interbank payments settlement, (2017); The Future is here — Project Ubin: SGD on distributed ledger, (2017); Whitepaper on distributed ledger technology, (2016); Payment systems: liquidity saving mechanisms in a distributed ledger environment, (2017); Yao Q., Development and supervision of digital currency (in Chinese), China Finance, 14, pp. 38-42, (2017); Danezis G., Meiklejohn S., Centrally banked crypto-currencies, (2016); Yao Q., Central bank encrypto-currency — analysis of RSCoin system (in Chinese), Caijing Weekly, 13, pp. 20-22, (2017); Yao Q., Li L.S., Application of big data analysis in digital currency (in Chinese), China Finance, 17, pp. 37-38, (2016); Yao Q., The application of digital currency in interbank cash transfer scenario (in Chinese), Finance Comput, 5, pp. 16-19, (2017); Xu Z., Yao Q., The preliminary plan of digital commercial paper trading platform (in Chinese), China Finance, 17, pp. 31-33, (2016); Stiglitz J.E., Macro-economic management in an electronic credit/financial system, NBER Working Paper 23032, (2017)","Q.

The analysis then discusses the concept of CBDCs and the various types of CBDC that are currently being advanced. The paper questions whether adoption of a pan-European CBDC would require a harmon-ised approach, or whether national solutions alone could suffice. The paper describes the legal aspects of the European payments landscape that would need to be adjusted in order to settle CBDC transactions without posing risks to payment system participants. The paper concludes by suggesting that this new form of money could broaden the discussions surrounding the institutional theory of money, and that a more cautious approach to the subject would be more likely to incline the European legis-lator to consider amendments to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and the Statute of the European System of Central Banks, should any decision be taken to embrace a CBDC. © Henry Stewart Publications,.","Central bank digital currency; Central banks; Legal tender; Money; Payment systems","","","","","","","","‘One Bank Research Agenda, (2015); Report on Virtual Currency Schemes, (2012); Mann F.A., ‘The Legal Aspect of Money, (1932); Knapp G.F., Staatliche Theorie Des Geldes, (1905); Nussbaum A., ‘Money in the Law National and International: A Comparative Study in the Borderline of Law and Economics, (1950); Vicuna S., An institutional theory of money, International Monetary and Financial Law: The Global Crisis, pp. 517-532, (2010); pp. 525-526; Mersch Y., Digital Base Money: An Assessment from the Ecbs perspective’, (2017); Wood P., Law and Practice of International Finance, (2008); Riksbank S., The Riksbank’s E-Krona Project — Report 2, (2018); Riksbank S., The Riksbank’s E-Krona Project — Report 1, (2017); Yanagawa N., Yamaoka H., Digital Innovation, Data Revolution and Central Bank Digital Currency, (2019); Mersch; Proctor C., ‘Mann on the Legal Aspects of Money, (2012); Draghi M., Comments Made at Press Conference, (2017); Benjamim J., Financial Law, (2007); Directive 2007/64/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 November, (2007); Malaguti C., The Payment Services Directive Pitfalls between the Acquis Communautaire and National Implementation —European Credit Research Institute Report, 9, (2009); Mavromati D., The Law of Payment Services in the EU — The EC Directive on Payment Services in the Internal Market, Kluwer Law, Alphen an Der Rijn, (2007); Revised Payments Services Directive, Annex I, Points 7 and 8; Crypto-Assets: Implications for Financial Stability, Monetary Policy and Payments and Market infrastructures’, (2019); OJ C109/10; European Central Bank, Ref. 27 Above, pp. 7-28; Bank of International Settlements, Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures, (2016); CPMI-IOSCO Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures, (2012); Ref. 6 Above; Riksbank S., Ref. 15 Above; Paech P., The governance of blockchain financial networks, Modern Law Review, 80, 6, (2017); Paech P., Securities, Intermediation and Blockchain — an Inevitable Choice between Liquidity and Legal Certainty?, (2016)","","","Henry Stewart Publications","","","","","","17501806","","","","English","J.

A comparative study was carried out considering countries for and against implementing a CBDC and their reasons, looking for common causes, differences, etc. The conclusion was that there are opposite tendencies between defenders and detractors of establishing a CBDC. However, today—and taking into account the positions of three large banking institutions (the Federal Reserve of the United States of America, the Bank of Japan and the Bank of England) on establishing (at least in the short term) a CBDC)—it seems that large-scale implementation is still far off. On the contrary, the Chinese Central Bank and banking systems of other countries that have less weight in the world, such as Uruguay, Lithuania and the Bahamas, seem to go against the trend of rejection and are seriously considering its implementation. Although this matter has been dealt with in the theoretical field, more pilot tests such as the one carried out by Uruguay are necessary in order to understand specific effects on the economy, on one hand, and on acceptance of its use by the population, on the other. © 2020 by the authors.

The paper presents two proposals for the implementation of such a currency: A moderate proposal in which only the banking sector continues to have access to deposits at the CB and a radical one in which the entire private sector is allowed to hold digital currency deposits at the CB. The paper contrasts the implications of those two polar paths to a CBDC for the funding of banks, the allocation of credit to the economy, for welfare and for political feasibility. One section of the paper shows that the radical implementation may pave the way toward a narrow banking system and dramatically reduce the need for deposit insurance in the long run. The paper evaluates the relative merits of issuing a currency on a blockchain using a permissionless distributed ledger technology in comparison to a centralized (permissioned) blockchain ledger operated by the CB and concludes that the latter dominates the former in more than one dimension. © 2020 The University of Manchester and John Wiley & Sons Ltd","blockchain technology; central bank digital currency; centralized versus decentralized currencies; narrow banking; permissioned; permissionless","","","","","","","","Adrian T., Mancini-Griffoli T., The rise of digital money, (2019); Aizenman J., On the built in instability of cryptocurrencies, (2019); Amihud Y., Cukierman A., The macroeconomic perils of a world with a private digital currency and how to address them, (2018); Auer R., The doomsday economics of ‘proof-of-work’ in cryptocurrencies, The Economics of Fintech and Digital Currencies, (2019); Barontini C., Holden H., Proceeding with caution – A survey on central bank digital currency, (2019); Benigno P., Monetary policy in a world of cryptocurrencies, (2019); Bordo M., Levin A., Central bank digital currency and the future of monetary policy, (2017); Budish E., The economic limits of the blockchain, (2018); Casey M., Crane J., Gensler G., Johnson S., Narula N., The Impact of Blockchain Technology on Finance: A catalyst for change, (2018); Cochrane J., Toward a run free financial system, (2014); Gandal N., Hamrick J.T., Moore T., Oberman T., Price manipulation in the Bitcoin ecosystem, Journal of Monetary Economics, 95, pp. 86-96, (2018); Gupta S., Lauppe P., Ravishankar S., Fedcoin: A Blockchain Backed Central Bank Cryptocurrency, (2017); Igan D., Mishra P., Wall Street, Capitol Hill, and K Street: Political influence and financial regulation, The Journal of Law and Economics, 57, 4, pp. 1063-1084, (2014); Lagarde C., Winds of change: The case for new digital currency, (2018); Lober K., Houben A., Central bank digital currencies, (2018); Mancini-Griffoli T., Martinez Peria M.S., Agur I., Ari A., Kiff J., Popescu A., Rochon C., Casting Light on Central Bank Digital Currency, (2018); Nakamoto S., Bitcoin: A peer-to-peer electronic cash system, (2008); Roubini N., Exploring the cryptocurrency and blockchain ecosystem, (2018)","A.

However, little attention has been given to the relevancy of electronic and digital payments (including a possible digital euro) in the area of taxation, where policies limiting the use of cash are being intensively adopted all around the world. On one hand, tax policies fostering the use of electronic and digital payments as a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) can help tax authorities to better monitor taxpayers’ transactions in the fight against tax evasion and fraud. On the other hand, important concerns arise in the areas of data protection and the digital divide. These two kinds of concern should be taken into account and addressed by policymakers before the adoption of both a CBDC and tax policies favouring its use at the detriment of cash. © 2021 Kluwer Law International BV, The Netherlands","Cashless Payments; CBDC; Data Protection; Digital Currencies; Digital Divide; Electronic Payments; Exchange of Information; GDPR; Tax Policy; Taxpayers’ rights","","","","","","","","Auer R., Bohme R., The Technology of Retail Central Bank Digital Currency, BIS Quarterly Review, (2020); 2 For example, at the beginning of 2020, the Bank of Canada, the Bank of England, the Bank of Japan, the European Central Bank, the Sveriges Riksbank and the Swiss National Bank, together with the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), have created a group to share experiences as they assess the potential cases for CBDCs in their home jurisdictions, (2020); Arner D.

Indeed, the discussion today remains dominated by arguments concerning the definition of money and the role of central banks. However, ‘money’ must be understood as a social agreement between economic agents who confer legitimacy and value upon it by agreeing to accept it, both now and in the future. This paper presents a framework to understand money as a social agreement in the age of digitisation using four different mechanisms: game theory with tokens, market-driven development of account-based money, liabilities (of banks to their clients and central banks to commercial banks), and a trust-based mechanism for digital coins provided by a central institution. Any development of money in the digital age must consider its users’ perception of stability, security, convenience, freedom of choice and trust in its ‘reusability’. Complementing the current discussion within central banks, this paper considers how social dynamics in the 21st century might challenge the traditional definition and acceptance of money. © Henry Stewart Publications.","Bitcoin; Central bank digital currency; Digital currency; Digital tokens; Nature of money","","","","","","","","Milkau U., Von Der Münze Zum Smartphone — Bezahlkultur Im Wandel, (2012); (1990); von Hayek F.A., The Denationalization of Money, (1976); Nakamoto S., Bitcoin: A Peer-To-Peer Electronic Cash System, (2008); Passas N., Demystifying hawala: A look into its social organization and mechanics, Journal of Scandinavian Studies in Criminology and Crime Prevention, 7, pp. 46-62, (2006); The Role of Hawala and Other Similar Service Providers in Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing, (2013); Luhmann N., Vertrauen: Ein Mechanismus Der Reduktion Sozialer Komplexität’, (1968); Carstens A., Cryptocurrencies a Potential Threat to Financial stability’, Video, (2018); Lober K., Houben A., Central Bank Digital Currencies’, Report Submitted by the Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures Markets Working Group, Bank for International Settlements, (2018); Jevons W.S., 1887) Money and the Mechanism of Exchange; Temin P., The Roman Market Economy, (2013); Jones D., The Bankers of Puteoli: Finance, Trade and Industry in the Roman World, (2006); Stasavage D., States of Credit, (2011); Arlinghaus F.-J., Double-entry bookkeeping, Medieval Italy: An Encyclopedia, 1, pp. 147-150, (2004); Pacioli L., Particularis de Computis et Scriptuis, The Rules of Double-Entry Bookkeeping, (2010); Fox D., Ernst W., Money in the Western Legal Tradition: Middle Ages to Bretton Woods, (2016); Huerta de Soto J., Money, Bank Credit, and Economic Cycles, (2006); Huerta de Soto J., Dinero, Crédito Bancario Y Ciclos Económicos, (1998); Schnabel I., Shin H.S., Money and Trust: Lessons from the 1620S for Money in the Digital age’, BIS Working Papers, No. 698; Available At, (2018); Goldberg D., The Massachusetts paper money of 1690, Journal of Economic History, 69, 4, pp. 1092-1106, (2009); Rothbard M.N., ‘The Myth of Free Banking in Scotland’ [review of L.H.

Moreover, on the basis of correcting shortcomings in the existing literature, we undertake a quantitative analysis of the economic impact of the issuance of DC/EP based on a four-sector DSGE model. The results demonstrate that the substitution effect of DC/EP on bank deposits is limited, while the unit impact can enhance the economic growth rate by 0.15% and the overall economic effect is positive, at the same time it reduces the leverage ratio to a certain degree, which is conducive to reducing systemic financial risk. Therefore, we contend that China should accelerate the research and development of DC/EP and launch pilot schemes to promote DC/EP. Moreover, China should actively participate in the drafting of international regulations for digital currencies, selectively liberalize the jurisdiction of overseas nodes, jointly establish an integrated digital infrastructure for future generations. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Central bank digital currency; crypto digital currency; economic impact; global stablecoin","","","","","","","","The Bank of Canada, European Central Bank, Bank of Japan, SverigesRiksbank, Swiss National Bank, Bank of England, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve and Bank for International Settlements, Central Bank Digital Currencies: Foundational Principles and Core Features, (2020); Barrdear J., Kumhof M., The Macroeconomics of Central Bank Issued Digital Currencies[R], Bank of England; Bernanke B., Gertler M., Gilchrist S., The Financial Accelerator in a Quantitative Business Cycle Framework; Broadbent B., Central Banks and Digital Currencies, (2016); Griffin J.M., Shams A., Is Bitcoin Really Un-Tethered?; Guofeng S., Shi C., On the Securities Properties and Legal Regulation of ICO, Management World, 2019, 12, pp. 45-52; ItaiAgur A.A., Dell' A., Designing Central Bank Digital Currencies; Jun M., Honglin W., Theoretical Model of Policy Interest Rate Transmission Mechanism, Journal of Financial Research, 2014, 12, pp. 1-22; Kumhof M., Noone C., “Central Bank Digital Currencies － Design Principles and Balance Sheet Implications”, Bank of England; Liqing Z., Tong W., The Application of Blockchain in the Financial Field: Theoretical Basis, Practical Issues and Strategy, Reform, 12, pp. 65-75; Nakamoto S., (2008); Qian Y., Currency Evolution Logic under Consensus Rules and Artificial Intelligence Issue of Fiat Currencies, Journal of Financial Research, 2018, 9, pp. 35-55; Qian Y., Analysis of the Economic Effects of Fiat Digital Currencies: Theory and Evidence, Journal of International Financial Research, 2019, 1, pp. 16-27; Tong W., Blockchain Reform: Reshaping Social Structure and Economic Patterns, (2018); Tong W., Advantages Constraints and Promotion Countermeasures of Decentralized Finance Based on Blockchain, Economic Review, 2020, 2, pp. 91-98; Tong W., Jianluan G., Economic Analysis of Facebook Cryptocurrency Libra: Background, Connotation, Impact and Challenges, Guizhou Social Sciences, 2019, 9, pp. 139-146; Tong W., Jiaqi L., Research on the Integration and Development of Blockchain and Finance, Journal of Financial Regulatory Research, 2018, 12, pp. 98-108; Tong W., Jiaqi L., Mengyu C., Theoretical Basis and Operating Mechanism of Fiat Digital Currency, Guizhou Social Sciences, 2020, 3, pp. 128-136; Tong W., Ming L., New Dimensions of Blockchain Financial Regulation and Governance, Finance and Economics, 2019, 11, pp. 1-11; Tong W., Yunsong X., Jiaqi L., Qingyang D., Does Digital Currency Have Safe Haven Property—based on the Perspective of Macroeconomic Financial Uncertainty, Journal of Financial Development Research, 7, pp. 1-12","C.

Private sector issuance of distributed ledger technology (DLT)-based digital currencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum and other altcoins threaten the stability of financial market infrastructures and preservation of monetary policy. Consequently, many central banks and monetary authorities have begun research and experimentation on central bank-issued digital currencies (CBDCs) to mitigate this threat. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of publicly available DLT-based CBDC experiments with completed proof-of-concept prototypes from across the world to enable an understanding of the motivations and best practice approaches for undertaking CBDC experiments. We provide a classification and generic framework for CBDCs and highlight existing DLT platform limitations and use cases in the financial services industry. Overall, our paper organizes in one place, all the relevant, publicly available DLT-based CBDC experiments with completed proof-of-concept prototypes to serve as a reference point for central banks, monetary authorities and researchers desiring to undertake research on DLT-based CBDCs. Ultimately, we present a survey on the technical feasibility and challenges of leveraging DLT to issue the selected CBDC experiments surveyed in this paper.  © 2013 IEEE.","CBDC; CBDC experiment; Central bank; digital currency; DLT; financial market infrastructure; proof-of-concept; prototype","Bitcoin; Finance; Surveys; Best practices; Financial services industries; Generic frameworks; Market infrastructure; Monetary policies; Private sectors; Proof of concept; Reference points; Service industry","","","","","Global Information and Telecommunication Technology Program; Institute for Information Communications Technology Planning & Evaluation; Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning, MSIP; Institute for Information and Communications Technology Promotion, IITP; Ministry of Science and ICT, South Korea, MSIT, (2017-0-00555)","This work was supported in part by the Global Information and Telecommunication Technology Program (GITTP) at KAIST with funding support from the Ministry of Science and ICT of the Republic of Korea, and in part by the Institute for Information Communications Technology Planning & Evaluation (IITP) grant funded by the Korea government (MSIT) (No. 2017-0-00555, Towards Provable-secure Multi-party Authenticated Key Exchange Protocol based on Lattices in a Quantum World).","Lien K., The Major Central Banks, (2019); Segal T., Central Banks, (2019); Virtual Currency Schemes, (2012); Nakamoto S., Bitcoin v0, (2018); Cryptocurrency Market Capitalization; Buterin V., Ethereum White Paper: A Next-Generation Smart Contract and Decentralized Application Platform, (2019); Schwartz D., Youngs N., Britto A., The Ripple Protocol Consensus Algorithm, (2014); Tether: Fiat Currencies on the Bitcoin Blockchain, (2018); Mazieres D., The Stellar Consensus Protocol: A Federated Model for Internet-Level Consensus, (2016); Fung B.S.C., Halaburda H., Central Bank Digital Currencies: A Framework for Assessing Why and How, (2016); Central Bank/Macroeconomics DLT Research List, (2019); Barontini C., Holden H., Proceeding with Caution-a Survey on Central Bank Digital Currency, (2019); One Bank Research Agenda, (2015); Danezis G., Meiklejohn S., Centrally banked cryptocurrencies, Proc.

Moreover, issuance of CBDC helps to address dilemmas of modern monetary policies, including inefficiencies in policy transmission, difficulties in countercyclical control, flow of currency away from the real economy to the virtual economy and inadequate management of policy expectations. This paper proposes a CBDC issuance framework based on forward contingencies. The incorporation of time, sector, and loan rate contingencies in the activation of CBDC will realize real-time transmission of monetary policy, enable targeted supply of money and prevent the currency from circulating beyond the real economy. The economic state contingency makes it possible to exercise countercyclical control of currency. The embedment of these contingencies also enables currency to perform the function of forward guidance. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Central Bank Digital Currency; forward guidance; monetary policy","","","","","","","","Mersch Y., Why Europe Still Needs Cash, (2017); Stiglitz J.E., Macro-Economic Management in an Electronic Credit/Financial System, NBER working paper No.23032, (2017); (2017); (2011); (2017)","Y.

In this setting, a central bank employs digital currency to transfer digital cash to each household, thus supporting consumption directly when needed. The asset side of the central bank’s balance sheet remains unchanged, and the creation of new digital cash is offset by a decrease in central bank equity. The central bank thus incurs an immediate loss but does not take on any additional risks for its future income statements. We address several objections to this policy, paying particular attention to the claim that weakening the financial strength of the central bank endangers long-term price stability. Through a meta-analysis of 176 estimates reported previously in the literature, we find that central bank financial strength has not historically correlated with inflation performance. © 2019, Association for Comparative Economic Studies.","Central bank digital currency; Central bank equity; Helicopter money; Inflation; Monetary policy; Seigniorage","","","","","","Grantová Agentura České Republiky, GACR, (18-02513S)","","Adler G., Castro P., Tovar C., Does Central Bank Capital Matter for Monetary Policy?, Open Economies Review, 27, 1, pp. 183-205, (2016); Agarwal R., Kimball M., Breaking Through the Zero Lower Bound, IMF Working Papers, 15, 224, (2015); Andrews I., Kasy M., Identification of and Correction for Publication Bias, American Economic Review, (2019); Bacchetta P., The Sovereign Money Initiative in Switzerland: An Economic Assessment, Swiss Journal of Economics and Statistics, 154, (2018); Ball L., The Case for a Long-Run Inflation Target of Four Percent, (2014); Bartels B., Weder Di Mauro B., Eichengreen B., No Smoking Gun: Private Shareholders, Governance Rules and Central Bank Financial Behavior, Annual Conference 2017: Alternative Structures for Money and Banking, (2017); Belke A., Helicopter Money: Should Central Banks Rain Money from the Sky?, Intereconomics: Review of International Trade and Development, 53, 1, pp. 34-40, (2018); Belke A., Polleit T., How Much Fiscal Backing Must the ECB Have?
